    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often provide chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning traces that appear plausible, but may hide internal biases. We call these *unverbalized biases*. Monitoring models via their stated reasoning is therefore unreliable, and existing bias evaluations typically require predefined categories and hand-crafted datasets. In this work, we introduce a fully automated, black-box pipeline for detecting task-specific unverbalized biases. Given a task dataset, the pipeline uses LLM autoraters to generate candidate bias concepts. It then tests each concept on progressively larger input samples by generating positive and negative variations, and applies statistical techniques for multiple testing and early stopping. A concept is flagged as an unverbalized bias if it yields statistically significant performance differences while not being cited as justification in the model's CoTs. We evaluate our pipeline across six LLMs on three decision tasks (hiring, loan approval, and university admissions). Our technique automatically discovers previously unknown biases in these models (e.g., Spanish fluency, English proficiency, writing formality). In the same run, the pipeline also validates biases that were manually identified by prior work (gender, race, religion, ethnicity). More broadly, our proposed approach provides a practical, scalable path to automatic task-specific bias discovery.",

However, existing scene-generation systems often rely on rule-based or task-specific pipelines, yielding artifacts and physically invalid scenes. We present SAGE, an agentic framework that, given a user-specified embodied task (e.g., \"pick up a bowl and place it on the table\"), understands the intent and automatically generates simulation-ready environments at scale. The agent couples multiple generators for layout and object composition with critics that evaluate semantic plausibility, visual realism, and physical stability. Through iterative reasoning and adaptive tool selection, it self-refines the scenes until meeting user intent and physical validity. The resulting environments are realistic, diverse, and directly deployable in modern simulators for policy training. Policies trained purely on this data exhibit clear scaling trends and generalize to unseen objects and layouts, demonstrating the promise of simulation-driven scaling for embodied AI.

    "abstract": "Multiple rotation averaging (MRA) is a fundamental optimization problem in 3D vision and robotics that aims to recover globally consistent absolute rotations from noisy relative measurements. Established classical methods, such as L1-IRLS and Shonan, face limitations including local minima susceptibility and reliance on convex relaxations that fail to preserve the exact manifold geometry, leading to reduced accuracy in high-noise scenarios. We introduce IQARS (Iterative Quantum Annealing for Rotation Synchronization), the first algorithm that reformulates MRA as a sequence of local quadratic non-convex sub-problems executable on quantum annealers after binarization, to leverage inherent hardware advantages. IQARS removes convex relaxation dependence and better preserves non-Euclidean rotation manifold geometry while leveraging quantum tunneling and parallelism for efficient solution space exploration. We evaluate IQARS's performance on synthetic and real-world datasets. While current annealers remain in their nascent phase and only support solving problems of limited scale with constrained performance, we observed that IQARS on D-Wave annealers can already achieve ca. 12% higher accuracy than Shonan, i.e., the best-performing classical method evaluated empirically.",

Unlike text-to-video models, existing I2V pipelines often suffer from appearance drift and geometric distortion, artifacts we attribute to the sparsity of single-view 2D observations and weak cross-modal alignment. Here we address this problem from both data and model perspectives. First, we curate ConsIDVid, a large-scale object-centric dataset built with a scalable pipeline for high-quality, temporally aligned videos, and establish ConsIDVid-Bench, where we present a novel benchmarking and evaluation framework for multi-view consistency using metrics sensitive to subtle geometric and appearance deviations. We further propose ConsID-Gen, a view-assisted I2V generation framework that augments the first frame with unposed auxiliary views and fuses semantic and structural cues via a dual-stream visual-geometric encoder as well as a text-visual connector, yielding unified conditioning for a Diffusion Transformer backbone. Experiments across ConsIDVid-Bench demonstrate that ConsID-Gen consistently outperforms in multiple metrics, with the best overall performance surpassing leading video generation models like Wan2.1 and HunyuanVideo, delivering superior identity fidelity and temporal coherence under challenging real-world scenarios.

    "abstract": "Scaling action-controllable world models is limited by the scarcity of action labels. While latent action learning promises to extract control interfaces from unlabeled video, learned latents often fail to transfer across contexts: they entangle scene-specific cues and lack a shared coordinate system. This occurs because standard objectives operate only within each clip, providing no mechanism to align action semantics across contexts. Our key insight is that although actions are unobserved, their semantic effects are observable and can serve as a shared reference. We introduce Seq$Δ$-REPA, a sequence-level control-effect alignment objective that anchors integrated latent action to temporal feature differences from a frozen, self-supervised video encoder. Building on this, we present Olaf-World, a pipeline that pretrains action-conditioned video world models from large-scale passive video. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method learns a more structured latent action space, leading to stronger zero-shot action transfer and more data-efficient adaptation to new control interfaces than state-of-the-art baselines.",

This work presents VideoWorld 2, which extends VideoWorld and offers the first investigation into learning transferable knowledge directly from raw real-world videos. At its core, VideoWorld 2 introduces a dynamic-enhanced Latent Dynamics Model (dLDM) that decouples action dynamics from visual appearance: a pretrained video diffusion model handles visual appearance modeling, enabling the dLDM to learn latent codes that focus on compact and meaningful task-related dynamics. These latent codes are then modeled autoregressively to learn task policies and support long-horizon reasoning. We evaluate VideoWorld 2 on challenging real-world handcraft making tasks, where prior video generation and latent-dynamics models struggle to operate reliably. Remarkably, VideoWorld 2 achieves up to 70% improvement in task success rate and produces coherent long execution videos. In robotics, we show that VideoWorld 2 can acquire effective manipulation knowledge from the Open-X dataset, which substantially improves task performance on CALVIN. This study reveals the potential of learning transferable world knowledge directly from raw videos, with all code, data, and models to be open-sourced for further research.",

    "abstract": "Data privacy and eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) are two important aspects for modern Machine Learning systems. To enhance data privacy, recent machine learning models have been designed as a Federated Learning (FL) system. On top of that, additional privacy layers can be added, via Differential Privacy (DP). On the other hand, to improve explainability, ML must consider more interpretable approaches with reduced number of features and less complex internal architecture. In this context, this paper aims to achieve a machine learning (ML) model that combines enhanced data privacy with explainability. So, we propose a FL solution, called Federated EXplainable Trees with Differential Privacy (FEXT-DP), that: (i) is based on Decision Trees, since they are lightweight and have superior explainability than neural networks-based FL systems; (ii) provides additional layer of data privacy protection applying Differential Privacy (DP) to the Tree-Based model. However, there is a side effect adding DP: it harms the explainability of the system. So, this paper also presents the impact of DP protection on the explainability of the ML model. The carried out performance assessment shows improvements of FEXT-DP in terms of a faster training, i.e., numbers of rounds, Mean Squared Error and explainability.",

    "abstract": "Leveraging representation encoders for generative modeling offers a path for efficient, high-fidelity synthesis. However, standard diffusion transformers fail to converge on these representations directly. While recent work attributes this to a capacity bottleneck proposing computationally expensive width scaling of diffusion transformers we demonstrate that the failure is fundamentally geometric. We identify Geometric Interference as the root cause: standard Euclidean flow matching forces probability paths through the low-density interior of the hyperspherical feature space of representation encoders, rather than following the manifold surface. To resolve this, we propose Riemannian Flow Matching with Jacobi Regularization (RJF). By constraining the generative process to the manifold geodesics and correcting for curvature-induced error propagation, RJF enables standard Diffusion Transformer architectures to converge without width scaling. Our method RJF enables the standard DiT-B architecture (131M parameters) to converge effectively, achieving an FID of 3.37 where prior methods fail to converge.

We introduce \\textit{Step-Decomposed Influence (SDI)}, which decomposes TracIn into a length-$τ$ influence trajectory by unrolling the recurrent computation graph and attributing influence to specific loop iterations. To make SDI practical at transformer scale, we propose a TensorSketch implementation that never materialises per-example gradients. Experiments on looped GPT-style models and algorithmic reasoning tasks show that SDI scales excellently, matches full-gradient baselines with low error and supports a broad range of data attribution and interpretability tasks with per-step insights into the latent reasoning process.",

Current causal diffusion models entangle temporal reasoning with iterative denoising, applying causal attention across all layers, at every denoising step, and over the entire context. In this paper, we show that the causal reasoning in these models is separable from the multi-step denoising process. Through systematic probing of autoregressive video diffusers, we uncover two key regularities: (1) early layers produce highly similar features across denoising steps, indicating redundant computation along the diffusion trajectory; and (2) deeper layers exhibit sparse cross-frame attention and primarily perform intra-frame rendering. Motivated by these findings, we introduce Separable Causal Diffusion (SCD), a new architecture that explicitly decouples once-per-frame temporal reasoning, via a causal transformer encoder, from multi-step frame-wise rendering, via a lightweight diffusion decoder. Extensive experiments on both pretraining and post-training tasks across synthetic and real benchmarks show that SCD significantly improves throughput and per-frame latency while matching or surpassing the generation quality of strong causal diffusion baselines.",

At its core, 4RC introduces a novel encode-once, query-anywhere and anytime paradigm: a transformer backbone encodes the entire video into a compact spatio-temporal latent space, from which a conditional decoder can efficiently query 3D geometry and motion for any query frame at any target timestamp. To facilitate learning, we represent per-view 4D attributes in a minimally factorized form by decomposing them into base geometry and time-dependent relative motion.

    "abstract": "Recent advances in large language model (LLM) have empowered autonomous agents to perform complex tasks that require multi-turn interactions with tools and environments. However, scaling such agent training is limited by the lack of diverse and reliable environments. In this paper, we propose Agent World Model (AWM), a fully synthetic environment generation pipeline. Using this pipeline, we scale to 1,000 environments covering everyday scenarios, in which agents can interact with rich toolsets (35 tools per environment on average) and obtain high-quality observations. Notably, these environments are code-driven and backed by databases, providing more reliable and consistent state transitions than environments simulated by LLMs. Moreover, they enable more efficient agent interaction compared with collecting trajectories from realistic environments. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this resource, we perform large-scale reinforcement learning for multi-turn tool-use agents. Thanks to the fully executable environments and accessible database states, we can also design reliable reward functions. Experiments on three benchmarks show that training exclusively in synthetic environments, rather than benchmark-specific ones, yields strong out-of-distribution generalization.

    "abstract": "Developing agents capable of open-endedly discovering and learning novel skills is a grand challenge in Artificial Intelligence. While reinforcement learning offers a powerful framework for training agents to master complex skills, it typically relies on hand-designed reward functions. This is infeasible for open-ended skill discovery, where the set of meaningful skills is not known a priori. While recent methods have shown promising results towards automating reward function design, they remain limited to refining rewards for pre-defined tasks. To address this limitation, we introduce Continuous Open-ended Discovery and Evolution of Skills as Hierarchical Reward Programs (CODE-SHARP), a novel framework leveraging Foundation Models (FM) to open-endedly expand and refine a hierarchical skill archive, structured as a directed graph of executable reward functions in code. We show that a goal-conditioned agent trained exclusively on the rewards generated by the discovered SHARP skills learns to solve increasingly long-horizon goals in the Craftax environment. When composed by a high-level FM-based planner, the discovered skills enable a single goal-conditioned agent to solve complex, long-horizon tasks, outperforming both pretrained agents and task-specific expert policies by over $134$% on average. We will open-source our code and provide additional videos $\\href{https://sites.google.com/view/code-sharp/homepage}{here}$.",

The complexity and variability of scientific tables and figures, combined with heterogeneous structures and long-context requirements, pose fundamental obstacles to scientific table \\& figure analysis. To quantify these challenges, we introduce AnaBench, a large-scale benchmark featuring $63,178$ instances from nine scientific domains, systematically categorized along seven complexity dimensions. To tackle these challenges, we propose Anagent, a multi-agent framework for enhanced scientific table \\& figure analysis through four specialized agents: Planner decomposes tasks into actionable subtasks, Expert retrieves task-specific information through targeted tool execution, Solver synthesizes information to generate coherent analysis, and Critic performs iterative refinement through five-dimensional quality assessment. We further develop modular training strategies that leverage supervised finetuning and specialized reinforcement learning to optimize individual capabilities while maintaining effective collaboration. Comprehensive evaluation across 170 subdomains demonstrates that Anagent achieves substantial improvements, up to $\\uparrow 13.43\\%$ in training-free settings and $\\uparrow 42.12\\%$ with finetuning, while revealing that task-oriented reasoning and context-aware problem-solving are essential for high-quality scientific table \\& figure analysis.

    "abstract": "We introduce Forensim, an attention-based state-space framework for image forgery detection that jointly localizes both manipulated (target) and source regions. Unlike traditional approaches that rely solely on artifact cues to detect spliced or forged areas, Forensim is designed to capture duplication patterns crucial for understanding context. In scenarios such as protest imagery, detecting only the forged region, for example a duplicated act of violence inserted into a peaceful crowd, can mislead interpretation, highlighting the need for joint source-target localization. Forensim outputs three-class masks (pristine, source, target) and supports detection of both splicing and copy-move forgeries within a unified architecture. We propose a visual state-space model that leverages normalized attention maps to identify internal similarities, paired with a region-based block attention module to distinguish manipulated regions. This design enables end-to-end training and precise localization. Forensim achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmarks. We also release CMFD-Anything, a new dataset addressing limitations of existing copy-move forgery datasets.",

Such features are traditionally used for test-time monitoring or steering. We present an alternative affordance: features as scalable supervision for open-ended tasks. We consider the case of hallucination-reduction as a desirable, yet open-ended behavior and design a reinforcement learning (RL) pipeline, titled RLFR (Reinforcement Learning from Feature Rewards), that uses features as reward functions. Grounded in a novel probing framework that identifies candidate hallucinated claims, our pipeline teaches a model to intervene and correct its completions when it is uncertain of their factuality. Furthermore, the pipeline enables scalable test-time compute, guided once more by our reward features. This end-to-end process operationalized on Gemma-3-12B-IT results in a policy that is 58% less likely to hallucinate compared to the original model, while preserving performance on standard benchmarks. Taken together, by grounding supervision in the language of features, this paper introduces a novel paradigm in the use of interpretability for learning open-ended tasks.",

    "abstract": "Human problem-solving is never the repetition of a single mindset, by which we mean a distinct mode of cognitive processing. When tackling a specific task, we do not rely on a single mindset; instead, we integrate multiple mindsets within the single solution process. However, existing LLM reasoning methods fall into a common trap: they apply the same fixed mindset across all steps, overlooking that different stages of solving the same problem require fundamentally different mindsets. This single-minded assumption prevents models from reaching the next level of intelligence. To address this limitation, we propose Chain of Mindset (CoM), a training-free agentic framework that enables step-level adaptive mindset orchestration. CoM decomposes reasoning into four functionally heterogeneous mindsets: Spatial, Convergent, Divergent, and Algorithmic. A Meta-Agent dynamically selects the optimal mindset based on the evolving reasoning state, while a bidirectional Context Gate filters cross-module information flow to maintain effectiveness and efficiency. Experiments across six challenging benchmarks spanning mathematics, code generation, scientific QA, and spatial reasoning demonstrate that CoM achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming the strongest baseline by 4.96\\% and 4.72\\% in overall accuracy on Qwen3-VL-32B-Instruct and Gemini-2.0-Flash, while balancing reasoning efficiency.

Existing post-hoc detectors typically rely on model confidence scores or likelihood estimates in feature space, often under restrictive distributional assumptions. In this work, we introduce a third paradigm and formulate OOD detection from a diversity perspective. We propose the Vendi Novelty Score (VNS), an OOD detector based on the Vendi Scores (VS), a family of similarity-based diversity metrics. VNS quantifies how much a test sample increases the VS of the in-distribution feature set, providing a principled notion of novelty that does not require density modeling. VNS is linear-time, non-parametric, and naturally combines class-conditional (local) and dataset-level (global) novelty signals. Across multiple image classification benchmarks and network architectures, VNS achieves state-of-the-art OOD detection performance. Remarkably, VNS retains this performance when computed using only 1% of the training data, enabling deployment in memory- or access-constrained settings.",

    "abstract": "We introduce WildCat, a high-accuracy, low-cost approach to compressing the attention mechanism in neural networks. While attention is a staple of modern network architectures, it is also notoriously expensive to deploy due to resource requirements that scale quadratically with the input sequence length $n$. WildCat avoids these quadratic costs by only attending over a small weighted coreset. Crucially, we select the coreset using a fast but spectrally-accurate subsampling algorithm -- randomly pivoted Cholesky -- and weight the elements optimally to minimise reconstruction error. Remarkably, given bounded inputs, WildCat approximates exact attention with super-polynomial $O(n^{-\\sqrt{\\log(\\log(n))}})$ error decay while running in near-linear $O(n^{1+o(1)})$ time. In contrast, prior practical approximations either lack error guarantees or require quadratic runtime to guarantee such high fidelity. We couple this advance with a GPU-optimized PyTorch implementation and a suite of benchmark experiments demonstrating the benefits of WildCat for image generation, image classification, and language model KV cache compression.",

Our approach modifies standard self-attention to process spatio-temporal feature sequences while maintaining computational efficiency and requiring minimal changes to existing architectures. STA demonstrates broad applicability across diverse transformer architectures and remains effective across both lightweight and larger-scale models. A comprehensive evaluation on the Cityscapes and BDD100k datasets shows substantial improvements of 9.20 percentage points in temporal consistency metrics and up to 1.76 percentage points in mean intersection over union compared to single-frame baselines.

This fully gradient-based loss requires neither uncertainty estimates nor constrained optimization. Our approach is plug-and-play with existing world model frameworks, preserving scalability while requiring only minimal modifications to standard training procedures.

    "abstract": "Head Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is routinely collected and shared for research under strict regulatory frameworks. These frameworks require removing potential identifiers before sharing. But, even after skull stripping, the brain parenchyma contains unique signatures that can match other MRIs from the same participants across databases, posing a privacy risk if additional data features are available. Current regulatory frameworks often mandate evaluating such risks based on the assessment of a certain level of reasonableness. Prior studies have already suggested that a brain MRI could enable participant linkage, but they have relied on training-based or computationally intensive methods.   Here, we demonstrate that linking an individual's skull-stripped T1-weighted MRI, which may lead to re-identification if other identifiers are available, is possible using standard preprocessing followed by image similarity computation. Nearly perfect linkage accuracy was achieved in matching data samples across various time intervals, scanner types, spatial resolutions, and acquisition protocols, despite potential cognitive decline, simulating MRI matching across databases. These results aim to contribute meaningfully to the development of thoughtful, forward-looking policies in medical data sharing.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies have demonstrated that incorporating Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning into the detection process can enhance a model's ability to detect synthetic images. However, excessively lengthy reasoning incurs substantial resource overhead, including token consumption and latency, which is particularly redundant when handling obviously generated forgeries. To address this issue, we propose Fake-HR1, a large-scale hybrid-reasoning model that, to the best of our knowledge, is the first to adaptively determine whether reasoning is necessary based on the characteristics of the generative detection task. To achieve this, we design a two-stage training framework: we first perform Hybrid Fine-Tuning (HFT) for cold-start initialization, followed by online reinforcement learning with Hybrid-Reasoning Grouped Policy Optimization (HGRPO) to implicitly learn when to select an appropriate reasoning mode. Experimental results show that Fake-HR1 adaptively performs reasoning across different types of queries, surpassing existing LLMs in both reasoning ability and generative detection performance, while significantly improving response efficiency.",

    "abstract": "In black-box combinatorial optimization, objective evaluations are often expensive, so high quality solutions must be found under a limited budget. Factorization machine with quantum annealing (FMQA) builds a quadratic surrogate model from evaluated samples and optimizes it on an Ising machine. However, FMQA requires binary decision variables, and for nonbinary structures such as integer permutations, the choice of binary encoding strongly affects search efficiency. If the encoding fails to reflect the original neighborhood structure, small Hamming moves may not correspond to meaningful modifications in the original solution space, and constrained problems can yield many infeasible candidates that waste evaluations. Recent work combines FMQA with a binary autoencoder (bAE) that learns a compact binary latent code from feasible solutions, yet the mechanism behind its performance gains is unclear. Using a small traveling salesman problem as an interpretable testbed, we show that the bAE reconstructs feasible tours accurately and, compared with manually designed encodings at similar compression, better aligns tour distances with latent Hamming distances, yields smoother neighborhoods under small bit flips, and produces fewer local optima. These geometric properties explain why bAE+FMQA improves the approximation ratio faster while maintaining feasibility throughout optimization, and they provide guidance for designing latent representations for black-box optimization.",

Crucially, in safety-critical domains, a rough estimate is insufficient to formally determine safety, i.e., guaranteeing safety even in the worst-case scenario, and external services might additionally not be trustworthy. We address this problem by presenting a certified pose estimation in 3D solely from a camera image and a well-known target geometry. This is realized by formally bounding the pose, which is computed by leveraging recent results from reachability analysis and formal neural network verification.

We propose a viewpoint in which both MPNNs and spectral GNNs are understood as different parametrizations of permutation-equivariant operators acting on graph signals. From this perspective, many popular architectures are equivalent in expressive power, while genuine gaps arise only in specific regimes. We further argue that MPNNs and spectral GNNs offer complementary strengths. That is, MPNNs provide a natural language for discrete structure and expressivity analysis using tools from logic and graph isomorphism research, while the spectral perspective provides principled tools for understanding smoothing, bottlenecks, stability, and community structure. Overall, we posit that progress in graph learning will be accelerated by clearly understanding the key similarities and differences between these two types of GNNs, and by working towards unifying these perspectives within a common theoretical and conceptual framework rather than treating them as competing paradigms.",

To address this problem, we propose a novel model that jointly achieves evidence retrieval, multi-modal claim verification, and explanation generation. For evidence retrieval, we construct a two-layer multi-modal graph for claims and evidence, where we design image-to-text and text-to-image reasoning for multi-modal retrieval. For claim verification, we propose token- and evidence-level fusion to integrate claim and evidence embeddings for multi-modal verification. For explanation generation, we introduce multi-modal Fusion-in-Decoder for explainability. Finally, since almost all the datasets are in general domain, we create a scientific dataset, AIChartClaim, in AI domain to complement claim verification community.

In this paper, we propose DRIFT, a novel dual-model architecture designed to explicitly decouple knowledge extraction from the reasoning process. Unlike static prompt compression, DRIFT employs a lightweight knowledge model to dynamically compress document chunks into implicit fact tokens conditioned on the query. These dense representations are projected into the reasoning model's embedding space, replacing raw, redundant text while maintaining inference accuracy. Extensive experiments show that DRIFT significantly improves performance on long-context tasks, outperforming strong baselines among comparably sized models. Our approach provides a scalable and efficient paradigm for extending the effective context window and reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Our code is available at https://github.com/Lancelot-Xie/DRIFT.",

    "abstract": "Reinforcement learning has become a cornerstone technique for developing reasoning models in complex tasks, ranging from mathematical problem-solving to imaginary reasoning. The optimization of these models typically relies on policy gradient methods, whose efficacy hinges on the accurate estimation of an advantage function. However, prevailing methods typically employ static advantage estimation, a practice that leads to inefficient credit assignment by neglecting the dynamic utility of training samples over time. This limitation results in suboptimal policy updates, which in turn manifest as slower convergence rates and increased learning instability, as models fail to adapt to evolving sample utilities effectively. To address this problem, we introduce \\textbf{ADORA} (\\textbf{A}dvantage \\textbf{D}ynamics via \\textbf{O}nline \\textbf{R}ollout \\textbf{A}daptation), a novel framework for policy optimization. ADORA dynamically adjusts the advantage function's weighting by adaptively categorizing training data into temporarily advantageous and disadvantageous samples, based on their evolving utility during online model rollouts. This tailored data differentiation strategy allows ADORA to be seamlessly integrated into existing policy optimization algorithms without significant architectural modifications, enabling the policy to prioritize learning from more informative experiences and thereby achieve more efficient policy updates. Extensive evaluations across diverse model families and varying data scales demonstrate that ADORA is a robust and efficient framework. It significantly enhances long reasoning in both geometric and mathematical tasks, consistently achieving notable performance gains without requiring sensitive hyperparameter tuning.",

To address this gap, we propose a multi-dimensional, reference-free evaluation framework that assesses LLM outputs along four complementary dimensions: specificity, robustness to paraphrasing and semantic perturbations, answer relevance, and context utilization. We introduce a curated dataset of 1,412 domain-specific question-answer pairs spanning 40 professional roles and seven natural hazard types to support systematic evaluation. We further conduct human evaluation to assess inter-annotator agreement and alignment between model outputs and human judgments, which highlights the inherent subjectivity of open-ended, domain-specific evaluation.

We make progress toward this goal by modeling each round of self-improvement as maximum-likelihood fine-tuning on a reward-filtered distribution and deriving finite-sample guarantees for the expected reward. Our analysis reveals an explicit feedback loop where better models accept more data per iteration, supporting sustained self-improvement while explaining eventual saturation of such improvement.

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) agents embedded in environments with physics-based interaction face many challenges including reasoning, planning, summarization, and question answering. This problem is exacerbated when a human user wishes to either guide or interact with the agent in natural language. Although the use of Language Models (LMs) is the default choice, as an AI tool, they struggle with tasks involving physics. The LM's capability for physical reasoning is learned from observational data, rather than being grounded in simulation. A common approach is to include simulation traces as context, but this suffers from poor scalability as simulation traces contain larger volumes of fine-grained numerical and semantic data. In this paper, we propose a natural language guided method to discover coarse-grained patterns (e.g., 'rigid-body collision', 'stable support', etc.) from detailed simulation logs. Specifically, we synthesize programs that operate on simulation logs and map them to a series of high level activated patterns. We show, through two physics benchmarks, that this annotated representation of the simulation log is more amenable to natural language reasoning about physical systems. We demonstrate how this method enables LMs to generate effective reward programs from goals specified in natural language, which may be used within the context of planning or supervised learning.",

    "abstract": "Building a search relevance model that achieves both low latency and high performance is a long-standing challenge in the search industry. To satisfy the millisecond-level response requirements of online systems while retaining the interpretable reasoning traces of Large Language Models (LLMs), we propose a novel \\textbf{Answer-First, Reason Later (AFRL)} paradigm. This paradigm requires the model to output the definitive relevance score in the very first token, followed by a structured logical explanation. Inspired by the success of reasoning models, we adopt a \"Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) + Reinforcement Learning (RL)\" pipeline to achieve AFRL. However, directly applying existing RL training often leads to \\textbf{mode collapse} in the search relevance task, where the model forgets complex long-tail rules in pursuit of high rewards. From an information theory perspective: RL inherently minimizes the \\textbf{Reverse KL divergence}, which tends to seek probability peaks (mode-seeking) and is prone to \"reward hacking.\" On the other hand, SFT minimizes the \\textbf{Forward KL divergence}, forcing the model to cover the data distribution (mode-covering) and effectively anchoring expert rules. Based on this insight, we propose a \\textbf{Mode-Balanced Optimization} strategy, incorporating an SFT auxiliary loss into Stepwise-GRPO training to balance these two properties. Furthermore, we construct an automated instruction evolution system and a multi-stage curriculum to ensure expert-level data quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our 32B teacher model achieves state-of-the-art performance. Moreover, the AFRL architecture enables efficient knowledge distillation, successfully transferring expert-level logic to a 0.6B model, thereby reconciling reasoning depth with deployment latency.",

Our method combines (i) a trajectory-based classifier that identifies when reasoning can be safely stopped, (ii) supervised fine-tuning to teach LRMs to propose self-generated <stop> signals, and (iii) <stop>-aware reinforcement learning that truncates rollouts at self-generated stop points with compute-aware rewards. Experiments on four reasoning datasets show that ESTAR reduces reasoning length by about 3.7x (from 4,799 to 1,290) while preserving accuracy (74.9% vs. 74.2%), with strong cross-domain generalization. These results highlight early stopping as a simple yet powerful mechanism for improving reasoning efficiency in LRMs.",

We further investigate underexplored aspects of the framework, including numerical stability, Gaussian truncation, and gradient approximation. The resulting system, Faster-GS, provides a rigorously optimized algorithm that we evaluate across a comprehensive suite of benchmarks. Our experiments demonstrate that Faster-GS achieves up to 5$\\times$ faster training while maintaining visual quality, establishing a new cost-effective and resource efficient baseline for 3DGS optimization. Furthermore, we demonstrate that optimizations can be applied to 4D Gaussian reconstruction, leading to efficient non-rigid scene optimization.",

According to the Poverty of the Stimulus Hypothesis (PoSH), the linguistic input children receive is insufficient to explain certain generalizations that are robustly learned; innate linguistic constraints, many have argued, are thus necessary to explain language learning. Neural language models, which lack such language-specific constraints in their design, offer a computational test of this longstanding (but controversial) claim. We introduce \\poshbench, a training-and-evaluation suite targeting question formation, islands to movement, and other English phenomena at the center of the PoSH arguments. Training Transformer models on 10--50M words of developmentally plausible text, we find indications of generalization on all phenomena even without direct positive evidence -- yet neural models remain less data-efficient and their generalizations are weaker than those of children. We further enhance our models with three recently proposed cognitively motivated inductive biases. We find these biases improve general syntactic competence but not \\poshbench performance. Our findings challenge the claim that innate syntax is the only possible route to generalization, while suggesting that human-like data efficiency requires inductive biases beyond those tested here.",

In this work, we compare two approaches for automated classification of stains using whole slide images, covering the 14 most commonly   used special stains in our institute alongside standard and frozen-section H&E. We evaluate a Multi-Instance Learning (MIL) pipeline and a proposed lightweight thumbnail-based approach.   On internal test data, MIL achieved the highest performance (macro F1: 0.941 for 16 classes; 0.969 for 14 merged classes), while the thumbnail approach remained competitive (0.897 and   0.953, respectively). On external TCGA data, the thumbnail model generalized best (weighted F1: 0.843 vs. 0.807 for MIL). The thumbnail approach also increased throughput by two orders of   magnitude (5.635 vs. 0.018 slides/s for MIL with all patches).

Through initial sensitivity analysis on configuration sensitivity, parameter scale, and training paradigm, we found that while small KANs are competitive on univariate polynomial residuals (Duffing), they exhibit severe hyperparameter fragility, instability in deeper configurations, and consistent failure on multiplicative terms (Van der Pol), generally outperformed by standard MLPs. These empirical challenges highlight limitations of the additive inductive bias in the original KAN formulation for state coupling and provide preliminary empirical evidence of inductive bias limitations for future hybrid modeling.",

On CIFAR-10, we show that making subtle edits via Infusion to just 0.2% (100/45,000) of the training documents can be competitive with the baseline of inserting a small number of explicit behavior examples. We also find that Infusion transfers across architectures (ResNet $\\leftrightarrow$ CNN), suggesting a single poisoned corpus can affect multiple independently trained models. In preliminary language experiments, we characterize when our approach increases the probability of target behaviors and when it fails, finding it most effective at amplifying behaviors the model has already learned. Taken together, these results show that small, subtle edits to training data can systematically shape model behavior, underscoring the importance of training data interpretability for adversaries and defenders alike.

In order to supervise a system that is already in operation, monitoring frameworks are frequently employed. These run continuously online in the background, supervising the system status and recording anomalies. This work proposes an online monitoring framework to detect anomalies in object state representations. Thereby, a key challenge is creating a framework for anomaly detection without anomaly labels, which are usually unavailable for unknown anomalies. To address this issue, this work applies a self-supervised embedding method to translate object data into a latent representation space. For this, a JEPA-based self-supervised prediction task is constructed, allowing training without anomaly labels and the creation of rich object embeddings. The resulting expressive JEPA embeddings serve as input for established anomaly detection methods, in order to identify anomalies within object state representations. This framework is particularly useful for applications in real-world environments, where new or unknown anomalies may occur during operation for which there are no labels available. Experiments performed on the publicly available, real-world nuScenes dataset illustrate the framework's capabilities.",

Effective recognition, reasoning, and editing often require not only forming such compositional representations, but also solving the decomposition problem. One popular choice for constructing these representations is through the binding operation. Resonator networks, which can be understood as coupled Hopfield networks, were proposed as a way to perform decomposition on such bound representations. Recent works have shown notable similarities between Hopfield networks and diffusion models. Motivated by these observations, we introduce a framework for semantic decomposition using coupled inference in diffusion models. Our method frames semantic decomposition as an inverse problem and couples the diffusion processes using a reconstruction-driven guidance term that encourages the composition of factor estimates to match the bound vector. We also introduce a novel iterative sampling scheme that improves the performance of our model. Finally, we show that attention-based resonator networks are a special case of our framework. Empirically, we demonstrate that our coupled inference framework outperforms resonator networks across a range of synthetic semantic decomposition tasks.",

Unlike standard parametric PINNs that map physical parameters directly to solutions, our method conditions the solver on a latent state optimized to reflect the metric-based separation between regimes, showing ~49% lower physics residual (0.082 vs. 0.160). We train this architecture using a phase-based Alternating Optimization (AO) schedule to manage gradient conflicts between the metric and physics objectives. Preliminary experiments on the Duffing Oscillator demonstrate that while standard baselines suffer from spectral bias and high-capacity Hypernetworks overfit (memorizing data while violating physics), our approach achieves stable convergence with 2.18x lower gradient variance than a multi-output Sobolev Error baseline, and 5x fewer parameters than a hypernetwork-based alternative.",

    "abstract": "Monitoring leftover products provides valuable insights that can be used to optimize future production. This is especially important for German bakeries because freshly baked goods have a very short shelf life. Automating this process can reduce labor costs, improve accuracy, and streamline operations. We propose automating this process using an object detection model to identify baked goods from images. However, the large diversity of German baked goods makes fully supervised training prohibitively expensive and limits scalability. Although open-vocabulary detectors (e.g., OWLv2, Grounding DINO) offer lexibility, we demonstrate that they are insufficient for our task. While motivated by bakeries, our work addresses the broader challenges of deploying computer vision in industries, where tasks are specialized and annotated datasets are scarce. We compile dataset splits with varying supervision levels, covering 19 classes of baked goods. We propose two training workflows to train an object detection model with limited supervision. First, we combine OWLv2 and Grounding DINO localization with image-level supervision to train the model in a weakly supervised manner. Second, we improve viewpoint robustness by fine-tuning on video frames annotated using Segment Anything 2 as a pseudo-label propagation model. Using these workflows, we train YOLOv11 for our detection task due to its favorable speed accuracy tradeoff. Relying solely on image-level supervision, the model achieves a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 0.91. Finetuning with pseudo-labels raises model performance by 19.3% under non-ideal deployment conditions. Combining these workflows trains a model that surpasses our fully-supervised baseline model under non-ideal deployment conditions, despite relying only on image-level supervision.",

    "abstract": "We study a canonical multi-task demand learning problem motivated by retail pricing, in which a firm seeks to estimate heterogeneous linear price-response functions across a large collection of decision contexts. Each context is characterized by rich observable covariates yet typically exhibits only limited historical price variation, motivating the use of multi-task learning to borrow strength across tasks. A central challenge in this setting is endogeneity: historical prices are chosen by managers or algorithms and may be arbitrarily correlated with unobserved, task-level demand determinants. Under such confounding by latent fundamentals, commonly used approaches, such as pooled regression and meta-learning, fail to identify causal price effects.   We propose a new estimation framework that achieves causal identification despite arbitrary dependence between prices and latent task structure. Our approach, Decision-Conditioned Masked-Outcome Meta-Learning (DCMOML), involves carefully designing the information set of a meta-learner to leverage cross-task heterogeneity while accounting for endogenous decision histories. Under a mild restriction on price adaptivity in each task, we establish that this method identifies the conditional mean of the task-specific causal parameters given the designed information set. Our results provide guarantees for large-scale demand estimation with endogenous prices and small per-task samples, offering a principled foundation for deploying causal, data-driven pricing models in operational environments.",

    "abstract": "Accurate modeling of drug release is essential for designing and developing controlled-release systems. Classical models (Fick, Higuchi, Peppas) rely on simplifying assumptions that limit their accuracy in complex geometries and release mechanisms. Here, we propose a novel approach using Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) and Bayesian PINNs (BPINNs) for predicting release from planar, 1D-wrinkled, and 2D-crumpled films. This approach uniquely integrates Fick's diffusion law with limited experimental data to enable accurate long-term predictions from short-term measurements, and is systematically benchmarked against classical drug release models. We embedded Fick's second law into PINN as loss with 10,000 Latin-hypercube collocation points and utilized previously published experimental datasets to assess drug release performance through mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean square error (RMSE), considering noisy conditions and limited-data scenarios. Our approach reduced mean error by up to 40% relative to classical baselines across all film types. The PINN formulation achieved RMSE <0.05 utilizing only the first 6% of the release time data (reducing 94% of release time required for the experiments) for the planar film. For wrinkled and crumpled films, the PINN reached RMSE <0.05 in 33% of the release time data. BPINNs provide tighter and more reliable uncertainty quantification under noise. By combining physical laws with experimental data, the proposed framework yields highly accurate long-term release predictions from short-term measurements, offering a practical route for accelerated characterization and more efficient early-stage drug release system formulation.",

Furthermore, we propose ViMultiChoice, a new method specifically designed for modeling Vietnamese reading comprehension that jointly predicts the correct answer and generates a corresponding explanation. Experimental results demonstrate that ViMultiChoice outperforms existing MCRC baselines, achieving state-of-the-art (SotA) performance on both the ViMMRC 2.0 benchmark and the newly introduced dataset.

    "abstract": "Large reasoning models trained with reinforcement learning and verifiable rewards (RLVR) achieve strong performance on complex reasoning tasks, yet often overthink, generating redundant reasoning without performance gains. Existing trajectory-level length penalties often fail to effectively shorten reasoning length and degrade accuracy, as they uniformly treat all reasoning steps and lack fine-grained signals to distinguish redundancy from necessity. Meanwhile, process-supervised methods are typically resource-intensive and suffer from inaccurate credit assignment. To address these issues, we propose ATTNPO, a low-overhead process-supervised RL framework that leverages the model's intrinsic attention signals for step-level credit assignment. We first identify a set of special attention heads that naturally focus on essential steps while suppressing redundant ones. By leveraging the attention scores of these heads, We then employ two sub-strategies to mitigate overthinking by discouraging redundant steps while preserving accuracy by reducing penalties on essential steps. Experimental results show that ATTNPO substantially reduces reasoning length while significantly improving performance across 9 benchmarks.",

    "abstract": "Urinary bladder cancer surveillance requires tracking tumor sites across repeated interventions, yet the deformable and hollow bladder lacks stable landmarks for orientation. While blood vessels visible during endoscopy offer a patient-specific \"vascular fingerprint\" for navigation, automated segmentation is challenged by imperfect endoscopic data, including sparse labels, artifacts like bubbles or variable lighting, continuous deformation, and mucosal folds that mimic vessels. State-of-the-art vessel segmentation methods often fail to address these domain-specific complexities. We introduce a Hybrid Attention-Convolution (HAC) architecture that combines Transformers to capture global vessel topology prior with a CNN that learns a residual refinement map to precisely recover thin-vessel details. To prioritize structural connectivity, the Transformer is trained on optimized ground truth data that exclude short and terminal branches. Furthermore, to address data scarcity, we employ a physics-aware pretraining, that is a self-supervised strategy using clinically grounded augmentations on unlabeled data. Evaluated on the BlaVeS dataset, consisting of endoscopic video frames, our approach achieves high accuracy (0.94) and superior precision (0.61) and clDice (0.66) compared to state-of-the-art medical segmentation models. Crucially, our method successfully suppresses false positives from mucosal folds that dynamically appear and vanish as the bladder fills and empties during surgery. Hence, HAC provides the reliable structural stability required for clinical navigation.",

    "abstract": "Clinical decision support requires not only correct answers but also clinically valid reasoning. We propose Differential Reasoning Learning (DRL), a framework that improves clinical agents by learning from reasoning discrepancies. From reference reasoning rationales (e.g., physician-authored clinical rationale, clinical guidelines, or outputs from more capable models) and the agent's free-form chain-of-thought (CoT), DRL extracts reasoning graphs as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) and performs a clinically weighted graph edit distance (GED)-based discrepancy analysis. An LLM-as-a-judge aligns semantically equivalent nodes and diagnoses discrepancies between graphs. These graph-level discrepancy diagnostics are converted into natural-language instructions and stored in a Differential Reasoning Knowledge Base (DR-KB). At inference, we retrieve top-$k$ instructions via Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to augment the agent prompt and patch likely logic gaps. Evaluation on open medical question answering (QA) benchmarks and a Return Visit Admissions (RVA) prediction task from internal clinical data demonstrates gains over baselines, improving both final-answer accuracy and reasoning fidelity. Ablation studies confirm gains from infusing reference reasoning rationales and the top-$k$ retrieval strategy. Clinicians' review of the output provides further assurance of the approach. Together, results suggest that DRL supports more reliable clinical decision-making in complex reasoning scenarios and offers a practical mechanism for deployment under limited token budgets.",

    "abstract": "Failures in large-scale cloud systems incur substantial financial losses, making automated Root Cause Analysis (RCA) essential for operational stability. Recent efforts leverage Large Language Model (LLM) agents to automate this task, yet existing systems exhibit low detection accuracy even with capable models, and current evaluation frameworks assess only final answer correctness without revealing why the agent's reasoning failed. This paper presents a process level failure analysis of LLM-based RCA agents. We execute the full OpenRCA benchmark across five LLM models, producing 1,675 agent runs, and classify observed failures into 12 pitfall types across intra-agent reasoning, inter-agent communication, and agent-environment interaction. Our analysis reveals that the most prevalent pitfalls, notably hallucinated data interpretation and incomplete exploration, persist across all models regardless of capability tier, indicating that these failures originate from the shared agent architecture rather than from individual model limitations. Controlled mitigation experiments further show that prompt engineering alone cannot resolve the dominant pitfalls, whereas enriching the inter-agent communication protocol reduces communication-related failures by up to 15 percentage points. The pitfall taxonomy and diagnostic methodology developed in this work provide a foundation for designing more reliable autonomous agents for cloud RCA.",

An important question thus arises: Can these encoders serve as versatile vision backbones, capable of reliably performing classic vision-centric tasks as well? To address the question, we make the following contributions: (i) we identify that the vision encoders within MLLMs exhibit deficiencies in their dense feature representations, as evidenced by their suboptimal performance on dense prediction tasks (e.g., semantic segmentation, depth estimation); (ii) we propose VersaViT, a well-rounded vision transformer that instantiates a novel multi-task framework for collaborative post-training. This framework facilitates the optimization of the vision backbone via lightweight task heads with multi-granularity supervision; (iii) extensive experiments across various downstream tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, yielding a versatile vision backbone suited for both language-mediated reasoning and pixel-level understanding.",

Standard bipartite matchers, which rely on geometric proximity, struggle when lesions appear, disappear, merge, or split. We propose a registration-aware matcher based on unbalanced optimal transport (UOT) that accommodates unequal lesion mass and adapts priors to patient-level tumor-load changes. Our transport cost blends (i) size-normalized geometry, (ii) local registration trust from the deformation-field Jacobian, and (iii) optional patch-level appearance consistency. The resulting transport plan is sparsified by relative pruning, yielding one-to-one matches as well as new, disappearing, merging, and splitting lesions without retraining or heuristic rules. On longitudinal CT data, our approach achieves consistently higher edge-detection precision and recall, improved lesion-state recall, and superior lesion-graph component F1 scores versus distance-only baselines.",

    "abstract": "Monocular normal estimation aims to estimate the normal map from a single RGB image of an object under arbitrary lights. Existing methods rely on deep models to directly predict normal maps. However, they often suffer from 3D misalignment: while the estimated normal maps may appear to have a correct appearance, the reconstructed surfaces often fail to align with the geometric details. We argue that this misalignment stems from the current paradigm: the model struggles to distinguish and reconstruct varying geometry represented in normal maps, as the differences in underlying geometry are reflected only through relatively subtle color variations. To address this issue, we propose a new paradigm that reformulates normal estimation as shading sequence estimation, where shading sequences are more sensitive to various geometric information. Building on this paradigm, we present RoSE, a method that leverages image-to-video generative models to predict shading sequences. The predicted shading sequences are then converted into normal maps by solving a simple ordinary least-squares problem. To enhance robustness and better handle complex objects, RoSE is trained on a synthetic dataset, MultiShade, with diverse shapes, materials, and light conditions. Experiments demonstrate that RoSE achieves state-of-the-art performance on real-world benchmark datasets for object-based monocular normal estimation.",

To address this gap, we introduce the Laparoscopic Skill Analysis and Assessment (LASANA) dataset, comprising 1270 stereo video recordings of four basic laparoscopic training tasks. Each recording is annotated with a structured skill rating, aggregated from three independent raters, as well as binary labels indicating the presence or absence of task-specific errors. The majority of recordings originate from a laparoscopic training course, thereby reflecting a natural variation in the skill of participants. To facilitate benchmarking of both existing and novel approaches for video-based skill assessment and error recognition, we provide predefined data splits for each task.

We investigate whether their own likelihood of success is recoverable from their internal representations before generation, and if this signal can guide more efficient inference. We train linear probes on pre-generation activations to predict policy-specific success on math and coding tasks, substantially outperforming surface features such as question length and TF-IDF. Using E2H-AMC, which provides both human and model performance on identical problems, we show that models encode a model-specific notion of difficulty that is distinct from human difficulty, and that this distinction increases with extended reasoning. Leveraging these probes, we demonstrate that routing queries across a pool of models can exceed the best-performing model whilst reducing inference cost by up to 70\\% on MATH, showing that internal representations enable practical efficiency gains even when they diverge from human intuitions about difficulty.

In order to accommodate changes in these high-level facial characteristics, this work introduces a shape and appearance-aware 3D reconstruction system (named SARS by us), a c modular pipeline that extracts body and face information from a single image to properly rebuild the 3D model of the human full body.",

The retrieval-ranking dataset contains 1,091 manually verified query-positive-negative document triplets drawn from diverse Amharic sources and constructed to support contrastive training and benchmarking of neural retrievers (e.g., DPR, ColBERT-style late interaction and SPLADE-style sparse neural retrieval). Triplets are created through a combination of expert-curated queries, web-derived queries, and LLM-assisted generation, with positive/negative documents selected from the web or synthesized by LLMs and then validated by native speakers. The instruction prompt-response dataset comprises 6,285 Amharic prompt-response pairs spanning multiple domains and instruction types, generated with several LLMs and refined through manual review and correction for grammaticality, relevance, fluency, and factual plausibility. We release both datasets with standardized splits and formats (CSV,JSON,JSONL) to enable reproducible work on Amharic retrieval, ranking, and generative modelling.

    "abstract": "Since the COVID-19 pandemic, online courses have expanded access to education, yet the absence of direct instructor support challenges learners' ability to self-regulate attention and engagement. Mind wandering and disengagement can be detrimental to learning outcomes, making their automated detection via video-based indicators a promising approach for real-time learner support. However, machine learning-based approaches often require sharing sensitive data, raising privacy concerns. Federated learning offers a privacy-preserving alternative by enabling decentralized model training while also distributing computational load. We propose a framework exploiting cross-device federated learning to address different manifestations of behavioral and cognitive disengagement during remote learning, specifically behavioral disengagement, mind wandering, and boredom. We fit video-based cognitive disengagement detection models using facial expressions and gaze features. By adopting federated learning, we safeguard users' data privacy through privacy-by-design and introduce a novel solution with the potential for real-time learner support. We further address challenges posed by eyeglasses by incorporating related features, enhancing overall model performance. To validate the performance of our approach, we conduct extensive experiments on five datasets and benchmark multiple federated learning algorithms. Our results show great promise for privacy-preserving educational technologies promoting learner engagement.",

    "abstract": "Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have emerged as the state-of-the-art backbone for high-fidelity image and video generation. However, their massive computational cost and memory footprint hinder deployment on edge devices. While post-training quantization (PTQ) has proven effective for large language models (LLMs), directly applying existing methods to DiTs yields suboptimal results due to the neglect of the unique temporal dynamics inherent in diffusion processes. In this paper, we propose AdaTSQ, a novel PTQ framework that pushes the Pareto frontier of efficiency and quality by exploiting the temporal sensitivity of DiTs. First, we propose a Pareto-aware timestep-dynamic bit-width allocation strategy. We model the quantization policy search as a constrained pathfinding problem. We utilize a beam search algorithm guided by end-to-end reconstruction error to dynamically assign layer-wise bit-widths across different timesteps. Second, we propose a Fisher-guided temporal calibration mechanism. It leverages temporal Fisher information to prioritize calibration data from highly sensitive timesteps, seamlessly integrating with Hessian-based weight optimization. Extensive experiments on four advanced DiTs (e.g., Flux-Dev, Flux-Schnell, Z-Image, and Wan2.1) demonstrate that AdaTSQ significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods like SVDQuant and ViDiT-Q.

This work proposes a novel embodied 4D world model that enables geometrically consistent, arbitrary-view RGBD generation: given only a single-view RGBD observation as input, the model imagines the remaining viewpoints, which can then be back-projected and fused to assemble a more complete 3D structure across time. To efficiently learn the multi-view, cross-modality generation, we explicitly design cross-view and cross-modality feature fusion that jointly encourage consistency between RGB and depth and enforce geometric alignment across views. Beyond prediction, converting generated futures into actions is often handled by inverse dynamics, which is ill-posed because multiple actions can explain the same transition. We address this with a test-time action optimization strategy that backpropagates through the generative model to infer a trajectory-level latent best matching the predicted future, and a residual inverse dynamics model that turns this trajectory prior into accurate executable actions. Experiments on three datasets demonstrate strong performance on both 4D scene generation and downstream manipulation, and ablations provide practical insights into the key design choices.",

Ideally, such systems would achieve continuous self-improvement in a fully closed loop while maintaining robust safety alignment--a combination we term the self-evolution trilemma. However, we demonstrate both theoretically and empirically that an agent society satisfying continuous self-evolution, complete isolation, and safety invariance is impossible. Drawing on an information-theoretic framework, we formalize safety as the divergence degree from anthropic value distributions. We theoretically demonstrate that isolated self-evolution induces statistical blind spots, leading to the irreversible degradation of the system's safety alignment. Empirical and qualitative results from an open-ended agent community (Moltbook) and two closed self-evolving systems reveal phenomena that align with our theoretical prediction of inevitable safety erosion. We further propose several solution directions to alleviate the identified safety concern. Our work establishes a fundamental limit on the self-evolving AI societies and shifts the discourse from symptom-driven safety patches to a principled understanding of intrinsic dynamical risks, highlighting the need for external oversight or novel safety-preserving mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Human activity recognition (HAR) on wearable and mobile devices is constrained by memory footprint and computational budget, yet competitive accuracy must be maintained across heterogeneous sensor configurations. Selective state space models (SSMs) offer linear time sequence processing with input dependent gating, presenting a compelling alternative to quadratic complexity attention mechanisms. However, the design space for deploying SSMs in the TinyML regime remains largely unexplored. In this paper, BabyMamba-HAR is introduced, a framework comprising two novel lightweight Mamba inspired architectures optimized for resource constrained HAR: (1) CI-BabyMamba-HAR, using a channel independent stem that processes each sensor channel through shared weight, but instance independent transformations to prevent cross channel noise propagation, and (2) Crossover-BiDir-BabyMamba-HAR, using an early fusion stem that achieves channel count independent computational complexity. Both variants incorporate weight tied bidirectional scanning and lightweight temporal attention pooling. Through evaluation across eight diverse benchmarks, it is demonstrated that Crossover-BiDir-BabyMamba-HAR achieves 86.52% average macro F1-score with approximately 27K parameters and 2.21M MACs, matching TinyHAR (86.16%) while requiring 11x fewer MACs on high channel datasets. Systematic ablation studies reveal that bidirectional scanning contributes up to 8.42% F1-score improvement, and gated temporal attention provides up to 8.94% F1-score gain over mean pooling. These findings establish practical design principles for deploying selective state space models as efficient TinyML backbones for HAR.",

    "abstract": "Steering methods influence Large Language Model behavior by identifying semantic directions in hidden representations, but are typically realized through inference-time activation interventions that apply a fixed, global modification to the model's internal states. While effective, such interventions often induce unfavorable attribute-utility trade-offs under strong control, as they ignore the fact that many behaviors are governed by a small and heterogeneous subset of model components. We propose Steer2Edit, a theoretically grounded, training-free framework that transforms steering vectors from inference-time control signals into diagnostic signals for component-level rank-1 weight editing. Instead of uniformly injecting a steering direction during generation, Steer2Edit selectively redistributes behavioral influence across individual attention heads and MLP neurons, yielding interpretable edits that preserve the standard forward pass and remain compatible with optimized parallel inference. Across safety alignment, hallucination mitigation, and reasoning efficiency, Steer2Edit consistently achieves more favorable attribute-utility trade-offs: at matched downstream performance, it improves safety by up to 17.2%, increases truthfulness by 9.8%, and reduces reasoning length by 12.2% on average. Overall, Steer2Edit provides a principled bridge between representation steering and weight editing by translating steering signals into interpretable, training-free parameter updates.",

We show that two-way attention transformers, which alternate between temporal and cross-sectional self-attention, can outperform standard baselines-Lasso, boosting methods, and fully connected multilayer perceptrons-across a wide range of settings, including low signal-to-noise regimes. We further introduce a dynamic sparsification procedure for attention matrices applied during training, and demonstrate that it becomes significantly effective in noisy environments, where the correlation between the target variable and the optimal predictor is on the order of a few percent. Analysis of the learned attention patterns reveals interpretable structure and suggests connections to sparsity-inducing regularization in classical regression, providing insight into why these models generalize effectively under noise.",

In this paper, we propose Free-GVC, a training-free generative video compression framework that reformulates video coding as latent trajectory compression guided by a video diffusion prior. Our method operates at the group-of-pictures (GOP) level, encoding video segments into a compact latent space and progressively compressing them along the diffusion trajectory. To ensure perceptually consistent reconstruction across GOPs, we introduce an Adaptive Quality Control module that dynamically constructs an online rate-perception surrogate model to predict the optimal diffusion step for each GOP. In addition, an Inter-GOP Alignment module establishes frame overlap and performs latent fusion between adjacent groups, thereby mitigating flicker and enhancing temporal coherence. Experiments show that Free-GVC achieves an average of 93.29% BD-Rate reduction in DISTS over the latest neural codec DCVC-RT, and a user study further confirms its superior perceptual quality and temporal coherence at ultra-low bitrates.",

    "abstract": "Clustering heterogeneous relational data remains a central challenge in graph learning, particularly when interactions involve more than two types of entities. While differentiable modularity objectives such as DMoN have enabled end-to-end community detection on homogeneous and bipartite graphs, extending these approaches to higher-order relational structures remains non-trivial.   In this work, we introduce a differentiable formulation of tripartite modularity for graphs composed of three node types connected through mediated interactions. Community structure is defined in terms of weighted co-paths across the tripartite graph, together with an exact factorized computation that avoids the explicit construction of dense third-order tensors. A structural normalization at pivot nodes is introduced to control extreme degree heterogeneity and ensure stable optimization.   The resulting objective can be optimized jointly with a graph neural network in an end-to-end manner, while retaining linear complexity in the number of edges. We validate the proposed framework on large-scale urban cadastral data, where it exhibits robust convergence behavior and produces spatially coherent partitions. These results highlight differentiable tripartite modularity as a generic methodological building block for unsupervised clustering of heterogeneous graphs.",

As a virtual sandbox, the GUI World model empowers agents with human-like foresight by enabling action-conditioned prediction. However, existing text- and pixel-based approaches struggle to simultaneously achieve high visual fidelity and fine-grained structural controllability. To this end, we propose Code2World, a vision-language coder that simulates the next visual state via renderable code generation. Specifically, to address the data scarcity problem, we construct AndroidCode by translating GUI trajectories into high-fidelity HTML and refining synthesized code through a visual-feedback revision mechanism, yielding a corpus of over 80K high-quality screen-action pairs. To adapt existing VLMs into code prediction, we first perform SFT as a cold start for format layout following, then further apply Render-Aware Reinforcement Learning which uses rendered outcome as the reward signal by enforcing visual semantic fidelity and action consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Code2World-8B achieves the top-performing next UI prediction, rivaling the competitive GPT-5 and Gemini-3-Pro-Image. Notably, Code2World significantly enhances downstream navigation success rates in a flexible manner, boosting Gemini-2.5-Flash by +9.5% on AndroidWorld navigation.

    "abstract": "Industrial anomaly detection demands precise reasoning over fine-grained defect patterns. However, existing multimodal large language models (MLLMs), pretrained on general-domain data, often struggle to capture category-specific anomalies, thereby limiting both detection accuracy and interpretability. To address these limitations, we propose Reason-IAD, a knowledge-guided dynamic latent reasoning framework for explainable industrial anomaly detection. Reason-IAD comprises two core components. First, a retrieval-augmented knowledge module incorporates category-specific textual descriptions into the model input, enabling context-aware reasoning over domain-specific defects. Second, an entropy-driven latent reasoning mechanism conducts iterative exploration within a compact latent space using optimizable latent think tokens, guided by an entropy-based reward that encourages confident and stable predictions. Furthermore, a dynamic visual injection strategy selectively incorporates the most informative image patches into the latent sequence, directing the reasoning process toward regions critical for anomaly detection. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that Reason-IAD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods. The code will be publicly available at https://github.com/chenpeng052/Reason-IAD.",

    "abstract": "Feature Engineering (FE) is pivotal in automated machine learning (AutoML) but remains a bottleneck for traditional methods, which treat it as a black-box search, operating within rigid, predefined search spaces and lacking domain awareness. While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising alternative by leveraging semantic reasoning to generate unbounded operators, existing methods fail to construct free-form FE pipelines, remaining confined to isolated subtasks such as feature generation. Most importantly, they are rarely optimized jointly with hyperparameter optimization (HPO) of the ML model, leading to greedy \"FE-then-HPO\" workflows that cannot capture strong FE-HPO interactions. In this paper, we present CoFEH, a collaborative framework that interleaves LLM-based FE and Bayesian HPO for robust end-to-end AutoML. CoFEH uses an LLM-driven FE optimizer powered by Tree of Thought (ToT) to explore flexible FE pipelines, a Bayesian optimization (BO) module to solve HPO, and a dynamic optimizer selector that realizes interleaved optimization by adaptively scheduling FE and HPO steps. Crucially, we introduce a mutual conditioning mechanism that shares context between LLM and BO, enabling mutually informed decisions. Experiments show that CoFEH not only outperforms traditional and LLM-based FE baselines, but also achieves superior end-to-end performance under joint optimization.",

    "abstract": "Autoregressive large language models (LLMs) scale well by expressing diverse tasks as sequences of discrete natural-language tokens and training with next-token prediction, which unifies comprehension and generation under self-supervision. Extending this paradigm to multimodal data requires a shared, discrete representation across modalities. However, most vision-language models (VLMs) still rely on a hybrid interface: discrete text tokens paired with continuous Vision Transformer (ViT) features. Because supervision is largely text-driven, these models are often biased toward understanding and cannot fully leverage large-scale self-supervised learning on non-text data. Recent work has explored discrete visual tokenization to enable fully autoregressive multimodal modeling, showing promising progress toward unified understanding and generation. Yet existing discrete vision tokens frequently lose information due to limited code capacity, resulting in noticeably weaker understanding than continuous-feature VLMs. We present Kelix, a fully discrete autoregressive unified model that closes the understanding gap between discrete and continuous visual representations.",

To address this gap, we introduce ARK, a benchmark designed to analyze multimodal retrieval from two complementary perspectives: (i) knowledge domains (five domains with 17 subtypes), which characterize the content and expertise retrieval relies on, and (ii) reasoning skills (six categories), which characterize the type of inference over multimodal evidence required to identify the correct candidate. Specifically, ARK evaluates retrieval with both unimodal and multimodal queries and candidates, covering 16 heterogeneous visual data types. To avoid shortcut matching during evaluation, most queries are paired with targeted hard negatives that require multi-step reasoning. We evaluate 23 representative text-based and multimodal retrievers on ARK and observe a pronounced gap between knowledge-intensive and reasoning-intensive retrieval, with fine-grained visual and spatial reasoning emerging as persistent bottlenecks. We further show that simple enhancements such as re-ranking and rewriting yield consistent improvements, but substantial headroom remains.",

We investigate quantification in Mandarin Chinese using a picture-based elicited description task in which speakers freely described scenes containing multiple objects, without explicit instructions to count or quantify. Across both spoken and written modalities, we examine three aspects of quantification: whether speakers choose to quantify at all, how precise their quantification is, and which quantificational strategies they adopt. Results show that object numerosity, animacy, and production modality systematically shape quantificational behaviour. In particular, increasing numerosity reduces both the likelihood and the precision of quantification, while animate referents and modality selectively modulate strategy choice. This study demonstrates how quantification can be examined under unconstrained production conditions and provides a naturalistic dataset for further analyses of quantity expression in language production.",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed to automatically label and analyze educational dialogue at scale, yet current pipelines lack reliable ways to detect when models are wrong. We investigate whether reasoning generated by LLMs can be used to predict the correctness of a model's own predictions. We analyze 30,300 teacher utterances from classroom dialogue, each labeled by multiple state-of-the-art LLMs with an instructional move construct and an accompanying reasoning. Using human-verified ground-truth labels, we frame the task as predicting whether a model's assigned label for a given utterance is correct. We encode LLM reasoning using Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) and evaluate five supervised classifiers. A Random Forest classifier achieves an F1 score of 0.83 (Recall = 0.854), successfully identifying most incorrect predictions and outperforming baselines. Training specialist detectors for specific instructional move constructs further improves performance on difficult constructs, indicating that error detection benefits from construct-specific linguistic cues. Using the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) framework, we examine four linguistic markers of correctness: Causation, Differentiation, Tentativeness, and Insight. Correct predictions exhibit grounded causal language (e.g., because, therefore), while incorrect reasoning is substantially more likely to rely on epistemic hedging (e.g., might, could) and performative metacognition (e.g., think, realize). Syntactic complexity does not distinguish correct from incorrect reasoning, and longer reasoning is not more reliable. These findings demonstrate that reasoning-based error detection offers a practical and scalable approach to quality control in automated educational dialogue analysis.",

In this work we study cross-lingual transfer of Arabic models using probing on 3 Natural Language Processing (NLP) Tasks, and representational similarity. Our results indicate that transfer is possible but disproportionate across dialects, which we find to be partially explained by their geographic proximity. Furthermore, we find evidence for negative interference in models trained to support all Arabic dialects. This questions their degree of similarity, and raises concerns for cross-lingual transfer in Arabic models.",

Inspired by the observation that humans are more error-prone when uncertain or hesitant, we investigate how instability in a model 's internal knowledge contributes to LVLM hallucinations. We conduct extensive empirical analyses from three perspectives, namely attention heads, model layers, and decoding tokens, and identify three key hallucination patterns: (i) visual activation drift across attention heads, (ii) pronounced knowledge fluctuations across layers, and (iii) visual focus distraction between neighboring output tokens. Building on these findings, we propose Stability-Aware Knowledge-Enhanced Decoding (SAKED), which introduces a layer-wise Knowledge Stability Score (KSS) to quantify knowledge stability throughout the model. By contrasting the most stability-aware and stability-agnostic layers, SAKED suppresses decoding noise and dynamically leverages the most reliable internal knowledge for faithful token generation. Moreover, SAKED is training-free and can be seamlessly integrated into different architectures. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SAKED achieves state-of-the-art performance for hallucination mitigation on various models, tasks, and benchmarks.",

To tackle the issues, Spatial Interpolation (SI) introduces virtual sensors to infer readings from observed sensors, leveraging graph structure. However, current graph-based SI methods rely on pre-trained models, lack adaptation to larger and unseen graphs at test-time, and overlook test data utilization. To address these issues, we propose PlugSI, a plug-and-play framework that refines test-time graph through two key innovations. First, we design an Unknown Topology Adapter (UTA) that adapts to the new graph structure of each small-batch at test-time, enhancing the generalization of SI pre-trained models. Second, we introduce a Temporal Balance Adapter (TBA) that maintains a stable historical consensus to guide UTA adaptation and prevent drifting caused by noise in the current batch. Empirically, extensive experiments demonstrate PlugSI can be seamlessly integrated into existing graph-based SI methods and provide significant improvement (e.g., a 10.81% reduction in MAE).",

Existing research mainly focuses on model improvements and sentence-level pruning, but often overlooks global structure, leading to disrupted coherence and weakened downstream performance. Some studies employ large language models (LLMs), which achieve higher accuracy but incur substantial resource and time costs. To address these issues, we introduce GloSA-sum, the first summarization approach that achieves global structure awareness via topological data analysis (TDA). GloSA-sum summarizes text efficiently while preserving semantic cores and logical dependencies. Specifically, we construct a semantic-weighted graph from sentence embeddings, where persistent homology identifies core semantics and logical structures, preserved in a ``protection pool'' as the backbone for summarization. We design a topology-guided iterative strategy, where lightweight proxy metrics approximate sentence importance to avoid repeated high-cost computations, thus preserving structural integrity while improving efficiency. To further enhance long-text processing, we propose a hierarchical strategy that integrates segment-level and global summarization. Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that GloSA-sum reduces redundancy while preserving semantic and logical integrity, striking a balance between accuracy and efficiency, and further benefits LLM downstream tasks by shortening contexts while retaining essential reasoning chains.",

This underrepresented downstream task addresses the subcategory of meta-scientific questions concerning the \"science of science.\" When compared to traditional scientific question answering based on papers, the task poses unique challenges in the planning phase. Namely, the need for named-entity recognition of academic entities within questions and multi-faceted data retrieval involving scientometric indices, e.g. impact factors. Beyond their exceptional capacity for treating traditional natural language processing tasks, LLMs have shown great potential in more complex applications, such as task decomposition and planning and reasoning. In this paper, we explore the application of LLMs to scientometric question answering, and describe an end-to-end system implementing a sequential workflow with retrieval-augmented generation and agentic concepts. We also address the secondary task of effectively synthesizing the data into presentable and well-structured high-level analyses. As a database for retrieval-augmented generation, we leverage a proprietary research performance assessment platform. For evaluation, we consult experienced subject matter experts and leverage LLMs-as-judges. In doing so, we provide valuable insights on the efficacy of LLMs towards a niche downstream task.

    "abstract": "High-quality novel view synthesis (NVS) from real-world videos is crucial for applications such as cultural heritage preservation, digital twins, and immersive media. However, real-world videos typically contain long sequences with irregular camera trajectories and unknown poses, leading to pose drift, feature misalignment, and geometric distortion during reconstruction. Moreover, lossy compression amplifies these issues by introducing inconsistencies that gradually degrade geometry and rendering quality. While recent studies have addressed either long-sequence NVS or unposed reconstruction, compression-aware approaches still focus on specific artifacts or limited scenarios, leaving diverse compression patterns in long videos insufficiently explored. In this paper, we propose CompSplat, a compression-aware training framework that explicitly models frame-wise compression characteristics to mitigate inter-frame inconsistency and accumulated geometric errors. CompSplat incorporates compression-aware frame weighting and an adaptive pruning strategy to enhance robustness and geometric consistency, particularly under heavy compression. Extensive experiments on challenging benchmarks, including Tanks and Temples, Free, and Hike, demonstrate that CompSplat achieves state-of-the-art rendering quality and pose accuracy, significantly surpassing most recent state-of-the-art NVS approaches under severe compression conditions.",

    "abstract": "Unsupervised Environment Design (UED) has emerged as a promising approach to developing general-purpose agents through automated curriculum generation. Popular UED methods focus on Open-Endedness, where teacher algorithms rely on stochastic processes for infinite generation of useful environments. This assumption becomes impractical in resource-constrained scenarios where teacher-student interaction opportunities are limited. To address this challenge, we introduce a hierarchical Markov Decision Process (MDP) framework for environment design. Our framework features a teacher agent that leverages student policy representations derived from discovered evaluation environments, enabling it to generate training environments based on the student's capabilities. To improve efficiency, we incorporate a generative model that augments the teacher's training dataset with synthetic data, reducing the need for teacher-student interactions. In experiments across several domains, we show that our method outperforms baseline approaches while requiring fewer teacher-student interactions in a single episode. The results suggest the applicability of our approach in settings where training opportunities are limited.",

    "abstract": "Transfer learning in deep reinforcement learning is often motivated by improved stability and reduced training cost, but it can also fail under substantial domain shift. This paper presents a controlled empirical study examining how architectural differences between Double Deep Q-Networks (DDQN) and Dueling DQN influence transfer behavior across environments. Using CartPole as a source task and LunarLander as a structurally distinct target task, we evaluate a fixed layer-wise representation transfer protocol under identical hyperparameters and training conditions, with baseline agents trained from scratch used to contextualize transfer effects. Empirical results show that DDQN consistently avoids negative transfer under the examined setup and maintains learning dynamics comparable to baseline performance in the target environment. In contrast, Dueling DQN consistently exhibits negative transfer under identical conditions, characterized by degraded rewards and unstable optimization behavior. Statistical analysis across multiple random seeds confirms a significant performance gap under transfer. These findings suggest that architectural inductive bias is strongly associated with robustness to cross-environment transfer in value-based deep reinforcement learning under the examined transfer protocol.",

Existing benchmarks either rely on image-centric or subjective metrics insensitive to structure, or evaluate intermediate symbolic representations rather than final rendered images, leaving pixel-based diagram generation underexplored. We introduce SciFlow-Bench, a structure-first benchmark for evaluating scientific diagram generation directly from pixel-level outputs. Built from real scientific PDFs, SciFlow-Bench pairs each source framework figure with a canonical ground-truth graph and evaluates models as black-box image generators under a closed-loop, round-trip protocol that inverse-parses generated diagram images back into structured graphs for comparison. This design enforces evaluation by structural recoverability rather than visual similarity alone, and is enabled by a hierarchical multi-agent system that coordinates planning, perception, and structural reasoning. Experiments show that preserving structural correctness remains a fundamental challenge, particularly for diagrams with complex topology, underscoring the need for structure-aware evaluation.",

We introduce a trace-optional framework that decomposes token efficiency into interpretable factors: completion under a fixed token budget (avoiding truncation), conditional correctness given completion, and verbosity (token usage). When benchmark metadata provides per-instance workload proxies, we further factor verbosity into two components: mean verbalization overhead (tokens per work unit) and a coupling coefficient capturing how overhead scales with task workload. When reasoning traces are available, we add deterministic trace-quality measures (grounding, repetition, prompt copying) to separate degenerate looping from verbose-but-engaged reasoning, avoiding human labeling and LLM judges. Evaluating 25 models on CogniLoad, we find that accuracy and token-efficiency rankings diverge (Spearman $ρ=0.63$), efficiency gaps are often driven by conditional correctness, and verbalization overhead varies by about 9 times (only weakly related to model scale). Our decomposition reveals distinct bottleneck profiles that suggest different efficiency interventions.",

We study LLM decision-making in a travel-assistant context by presenting models with choice dilemmas and analyzing their responses using multinomial logit models to derive implied willingness to pay (WTP) estimates. These WTP values are subsequently compared to human benchmark values from the economics literature. In addition to a baseline setting, we examine how model behavior changes under more realistic conditions, including the provision of information about users' past choices and persona-based prompting. Our results show that while meaningful WTP values can be derived for larger LLMs, they also display systematic deviations at the attribute level. Additionally, they tend to overestimate human WTP overall, particularly when expensive options or business-oriented personas are introduced. Conditioning models on prior preferences for cheaper options yields valuations that are closer to human benchmarks. Overall, our findings highlight both the potential and the limitations of using LLMs for subjective decision support and underscore the importance of careful model selection, prompt design, and user representation when deploying such systems in practice.",

    "abstract": "Recently, a Symbolic Pattern Planning (SPP) approach was proposed for numeric planning where a pattern (i.e., a finite sequence of actions) suggests a causal order between actions. The pattern is then encoded in a SMT formula whose models correspond to valid plans. If the suggestion by the pattern is inaccurate and no valid plan can be found, the pattern is extended until it contains the causal order of actions in a valid plan, making the approach complete. In this paper, we extend the SPP approach to the temporal planning with Intermediate Conditions and Effects (ICEs) fragment, where $(i)$ actions are durative (and thus can overlap over time) and have conditions/effects which can be checked/applied at any time during an action's execution, and $(ii)$ one can specify plan's conditions/effects that must be checked/applied at specific times during the plan execution. Experimental results show that our SPP planner Patty $(i)$ outperforms all other planners in the literature in the majority of temporal domains without ICEs, $(ii)$ obtains comparable results with the SoTA search planner for ICS in literature domains with ICEs, and $(iii)$ outperforms the same planner in a novel domain based on a real-world application.",

    "abstract": "Chain-of-Thought (CoT) has been shown to significantly improve the reasoning accuracy of large language models (LLMs) on complex tasks. However, due to the autoregressive, step-by-step generation paradigm, existing CoT methods suffer from two fundamental limitations. First, the reasoning process is highly sensitive to early decisions: once an initial error is introduced, it tends to propagate and amplify through subsequent steps, while the lack of a global coordination and revision mechanism makes such errors difficult to correct, ultimately leading to distorted reasoning chains. Second, current CoT approaches lack structured analysis techniques for filtering redundant reasoning and extracting key reasoning features, resulting in unstable reasoning processes and limited interpretability. To address these issues, we propose GHS-TDA. GHS-TDA first constructs a semantically enriched global hypothesis graph to aggregate, align, and coordinate multiple candidate reasoning paths, thereby providing alternative global correction routes when local reasoning fails. It then applies topological data analysis based on persistent homology to capture stable multi-scale structures, remove redundancy and inconsistencies, and extract a more reliable reasoning skeleton. By jointly leveraging reasoning diversity and topological stability, GHS-TDA achieves self-adaptive convergence, produces high-confidence and interpretable reasoning paths, and consistently outperforms strong baselines in terms of both accuracy and robustness across multiple reasoning benchmarks.",

    "abstract": "Isolated REM sleep behavior disorder (iRBD) is a key prodromal marker of Parkinson's disease (PD), and video-polysomnography (vPSG) remains the diagnostic gold standard. However, manual sleep staging is particularly challenging in neurodegenerative diseases due to EEG abnormalities and fragmented sleep, making PSG assessments a bottleneck for deploying new RBD screening technologies at scale. We adapted U-Sleep, a deep neural network, for generalizable sleep staging in PD and iRBD. A pretrained U-Sleep model, based on a large publicly available, multisite non-neurodegenerative dataset (PUB; 19,236 PSGs across 12 sites), was fine-tuned on research datasets from two centers (Lundbeck Foundation Parkinson's Disease Research Center (PACE) and the Cologne-Bonn Cohort (CBC); 112 PD, 138 iRBD, 89 age-matched controls. The resulting model was evaluated on an independent dataset from the Danish Center for Sleep Medicine (DCSM; 81 PD, 36 iRBD, 87 sleep-clinic controls). A subset of PSGs with low agreement between the human rater and the model (\\k{appa} < 0.6) was re-scored by a second blinded human rater to identify sources of disagreement. Finally, we applied confidence-based thresholds to optimize REM sleep staging. The pretrained model achieved mean \\k{appa} = 0.81 in PUB, but \\k{appa} = 0.66 when applied directly to PACE/CBC. By fine-tuning the model, we developed a generalized model with \\k{appa} = 0.74 on PACE/CBC (p < 0.001 vs. the pretrained model). In DCSM, mean and median \\k{appa} increased from 0.60 to 0.64 (p < 0.001) and 0.64 to 0.69 (p < 0.001), respectively. In the interrater study, PSGs with low agreement between the model and the initial scorer showed similarly low agreement between human scorers. Applying a confidence threshold increased the proportion of correctly identified REM sleep epochs from 85% to 95.5%, while preserving sufficient (> 5 min) REM sleep for 95% of subjects.",

    "abstract": "Scaling up model parameters has long been a prevalent training paradigm driven by the assumption that larger models yield superior generation capabilities. However, under lossy context compression in a compressor-decoder setup, we observe a Size-Fidelity Paradox: increasing the compressor size can lessen the faithfulness of reconstructed contexts though training loss decreases. Through extensive experiments across models from 0.6B to 90B, we coin this paradox arising from two dominant factors: 1) knowledge overwriting: larger models increasingly replace source facts with their own prior beliefs, e.g., ``the white strawberry'' $\\to$ ``the red strawberry''; and 2) semantic drift: larger models tend to paraphrase or restructure content instead of reproducing it verbatim, e.g., ``Alice hit Bob'' $\\to$ ``Bob hit Alice''. By holding model size fixed, we reflect on the emergent properties of compressed context representations. We show that the culprit is not parameter count itself, but the excessive semantic capacity and amplified generative uncertainty that accompany scaling. Specifically, the increased rank of context embeddings facilitates prior knowledge intrusion, whereas higher entropy over token prediction distributions promotes rewriting. Our results complement existing evaluations over context compression paradigm, underpinning a breakdown in scaling laws for faithful preservation in open-ended generation.",

Our findings reveal that current ASR performance remains significantly below deployment standards in a narrow formal domain; the top-performing system in terms of Word Error Rate (WER) achieved 46.76\\% and the best Character Error Rate (CER) of 13.00\\% was set by another model, while several prominent multilingual models exceeded 100\\% WER.

The same directions that identify circuit components also enable controlled steering -- achieving 69.8\\% emotion classification accuracy versus 53.1\\% for instruction prompting while preserving factual accuracy.

We formalize this as the \\emph{Invariant Subspace Necessity} theorem and derive the \\emph{Self-Reference Property}: tokens directly provide the geometric direction for their associated features, enabling zero-shot identification of semantic structure without labeled data or learned probes. Empirical validation in eight classification tasks and four model families confirms the alignment between class tokens and semantically related instances. Our framework provides \\textbf{a principled architectural explanation} for why linear interpretability methods work, unifying linear probes and sparse autoencoders.",

    "abstract": "Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a critical method for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, continuous training often leads to policy entropy collapse, characterized by a rapid decay in entropy that results in premature overconfidence, reduced output diversity, and vanishing gradient norms that inhibit learning. Gradient-Preserving Clipping is a primary factor influencing these dynamics, but existing mitigation strategies are largely static and lack a framework connecting clipping mechanisms to precise entropy control. This paper proposes reshaping entropy control in RL from the perspective of Gradient-Preserving Clipping. We first theoretically and empirically verify the contributions of specific importance sampling ratio regions to entropy growth and reduction. Leveraging these findings, we introduce a novel regulation mechanism using dynamic clipping threshold to precisely manage entropy. Furthermore, we design and evaluate dynamic entropy control strategies, including increase-then-decrease, decrease-increase-decrease, and oscillatory decay. Experimental results demonstrate that these strategies effectively mitigate entropy collapse, and achieve superior performance across multiple benchmarks.",

Although diffusion models have shown strong performance in generating realistic medical images, their internal decision making process remains largely opaque. We present a faithfulness-based explainability framework that analyzes how prototype-based explainability methods like ProtoPNet (PPNet), Enhanced ProtoPNet (EPPNet), and ProtoPool can link the relationship between generated and training features. Our study focuses on understanding the reasoning behind image formation through denoising trajectory of diffusion model and subsequently prototype explainability with faithfulness analysis. Experimental analysis shows that EPPNet achieves the highest faithfulness (with score 0.1534), offering more reliable insights, and explainability into the generative process. The results highlight that diffusion models can be made more transparent and trustworthy through faithfulness-based explanations, contributing to safer and more interpretable applications of generative AI in healthcare.",

We geographically profile large-scale multimodal datasets by mapping image-caption pairs to countries based on location information extracted from captions using LLMs. Studying English captions from three widely used datasets (Re-LAION, DataComp1B, and Conceptual Captions) across $20$ common entities (e.g., house, flag), we find that the United States, the United Kingdom, and Canada account for $48.0\\%$ of samples, while South American and African countries are severely under-represented with only $1.8\\%$ and $3.8\\%$ of images, respectively. We observe a strong correlation between a country's GDP and its representation in the data ($ρ= 0.82$). Examining non-English subsets for $4$ languages from the Re-LAION dataset, we find that representation skews heavily toward countries where these languages are predominantly spoken. Additionally, we find that higher representation does not necessarily translate to greater visual or semantic diversity. Finally, analyzing country-specific images generated by Stable Diffusion v1.3 trained on Re-LAION, we show that while generations appear realistic, they are severely limited in their coverage compared to real-world images.",

In this work, we frame visual self-supervised learning as a discrete communication process between a teacher and a student network, where semantic information is transmitted through a fixed-capacity binary channel. Rather than aligning continuous features, the student predicts multi-label binary messages produced by the teacher. Discrete agreement is enforced through an element-wise binary cross-entropy objective, while a coding-rate regularization term encourages effective utilization of the constrained channel, promoting structured representations. We further show that periodically reinitializing the projection head strengthens this effect by encouraging embeddings that remain predictive across multiple discrete encodings. Extensive experiments demonstrate consistent improvements over continuous agreement baselines on image classification, retrieval, and dense visual prediction tasks, as well as under domain shift through self-supervised adaptation. Beyond backbone representations, we analyze the learned binary codes and show that they form a compact and informative discrete language, capturing semantic factors reusable across classes.",

Most studies on LSC focus on improving the performance of estimating the degree of LSC, however, it is often difficult to interpret how the meaning of a word change. Enhancing the interpretability of LSC is a significant challenge as it could lead to novel insights in this field. To tackle this challenge, we propose a method to map the semantic space of contextualized embeddings of words obtained by a pre-trained language model to a neurobiological feature space. In the neurobiological feature space, each dimension corresponds to a primitive feature of words, and its value represents the intensity of that feature. This enables humans to interpret LSC systematically. When employed for the estimation of the degree of LSC, our method demonstrates superior performance in comparison to the majority of the previous methods. In addition, given the high interpretability of the proposed method, several analyses on LSC are carried out. The results demonstrate that our method not only discovers interesting types of LSC that have been overlooked in previous studies but also effectively searches for words with specific types of LSC.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the reliability of natural language generation is critical for deploying foundation models in security-sensitive domains. While certified poisoning defenses provide provable robustness bounds for classification tasks, they are fundamentally ill-equipped for autoregressive generation: they cannot handle sequential predictions or the exponentially large output space of language models. To establish a framework for certified natural language generation, we formalize two security properties: stability (robustness to any change in generation) and validity (robustness to targeted, harmful changes in generation). We introduce Targeted Partition Aggregation (TPA), the first algorithm to certify validity/targeted attacks by computing the minimum poisoning budget needed to induce a specific harmful class, token, or phrase. Further, we extend TPA to provide tighter guarantees for multi-turn generations using mixed integer linear programming (MILP). Empirically, we demonstrate TPA's effectiveness across diverse settings including: certifying validity of agent tool-calling when adversaries modify up to 0.5% of the dataset and certifying 8-token stability horizons in preference-based alignment. Though inference-time latency remains an open challenge, our contributions enable certified deployment of language models in security-critical applications.",

However, achieving precise control over fine-grained facial movements remains a significant challenge, particularly due to lip-synchronization inaccuracies and facial jitter, both of which can contribute to the uncanny valley effect. To address these challenges, we propose Fine-Grained 3D Gaussian Splatting (FG-3DGS), a novel framework that enables temporally consistent and high-fidelity talking head generation. Our method introduces a frequency-aware disentanglement strategy to explicitly model facial regions based on their motion characteristics. Low-frequency regions, such as the cheeks, nose, and forehead, are jointly modeled using a standard MLP, while high-frequency regions, including the eyes and mouth, are captured separately using a dedicated network guided by facial area masks. The predicted motion dynamics, represented as Gaussian deltas, are applied to the static Gaussians to generate the final head frames, which are rendered via a rasterizer using frame-specific camera parameters. Additionally, a high-frequency-refined post-rendering alignment mechanism, learned from large-scale audio-video pairs by a pretrained model, is incorporated to enhance per-frame generation and achieve more accurate lip synchronization. Extensive experiments on widely used datasets for talking head generation demonstrate that our method outperforms recent state-of-the-art approaches in producing high-fidelity, lip-synced talking head videos.",

We propose a hybrid approach that models crack detection as an inverse problem, decomposing an observed image into a crack-free painting and a crack component. A deep generative model is employed as powerful prior for the underlying artwork, while crack structures are captured using a Mumford--Shah-type variational functional together with a crack prior. Joint optimization yields a pixel-level map of crack localizations in the painting.",

    "abstract": "Deep reinforcement learning has been able to solve various tasks successfully, however, due to the construction of policy gradient and training dynamics, tuning deep reinforcement learning models remains challenging. As one of the most successful deep reinforcement-learning algorithm, the Proximal Policy Optimization algorithm (PPO) clips the policy gradient within a conservative on-policy updates, which ensures reliable and stable policy improvement. However, this training pattern may sacrifice sample efficiency. On the other hand, off-policy methods make more adequate use of data through sample reuse, though at the cost of increased the estimation variance and bias. To leverage the advantages of both, in this paper, we propose a new PPO variant based on the stability guarantee from conservative on-policy iteration with a more efficient off-policy data utilization. Specifically, we first derive an extended off-policy improvement from an expectation form of generalized policy improvement lower bound. Then, we extend the clipping mechanism with segmented exponential functions for a suitable surrogate objective function. Third, the trajectories generated by the past $M$ policies are organized in the replay buffer for off-policy training. We refer to this method as Extended Off-policy Proximal Policy Optimization (ExO-PPO). Compared with PPO and some other state-of-the-art variants, we demonstrate an improved performance of ExO-PPO with balanced sample efficiency and stability on varied tasks in the empirical experiments.",

Aggregated from 12 online biblical libraries and one preexisting corpus, each translation is manually annotated with metadata that maps the text to a standardized identifier for the work, its specific edition, and its year of revision. This canonicalization empowers researchers to define \"uniqueness\" for their own needs: they can perform micro-level analyses on translation families, such as the KJV lineage, or conduct macro-level studies by deduplicating closely related texts.

    "abstract": "The emerging paradigm of AI co-scientists focuses on tasks characterized by repeatable verification, where agents explore search spaces in 'guess and check' loops. This paradigm does not extend to problems where repeated evaluation is impossible and ground truth is established by the consensus synthesis of theory and existing evidence. We evaluate a Gemini-based AI environment designed to support collaborative scientific assessment, integrated into a standard scientific workflow. In collaboration with a diverse group of 13 scientists working in the field of climate science, we tested the system on a complex topic: the stability of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC). Our results show that AI can accelerate the scientific workflow. The group produced a comprehensive synthesis of 79 papers through 104 revision cycles in just over 46 person-hours. AI contribution was significant: most AI-generated content was retained in the report. AI also helped maintain logical consistency and presentation quality. However, expert additions were crucial to ensure its acceptability: less than half of the report was produced by AI. Furthermore, substantial oversight was required to expand and elevate the content to rigorous scientific standards.",

    "abstract": "Test-time adaptation (TTA) for large language models (LLMs) updates model parameters at inference time using signals available at deployment. This paper focuses on a common yet under-explored regime: unsupervised, sample-specific TTA, where the model adapts independently for each prompt using only the prompt itself, without gold answers or external supervision. Although appealing, naive unsupervised TTA with a fixed, handcrafted learning rate can be unstable: updates may overfit to prompt-specific statistics, drift from the desired answer distribution, and ultimately degrade generation quality. This failure mode is not surprising, as in this case TTA must adapt to a single prompt within only a few gradient steps, unlike standard training that averages updates over large datasets and long optimization horizons. Therefore, we propose layer-wise dynamic test-time adaptation, a framework which explicitly modulates TTA strength as a function of prompt representation, LLM structure and adaptation step. In our setting, TTA updates only LoRA parameters, and a lightweight hypernetwork predicts per-layer, per-step learning-rate multipliers, enabling fine-grained control. Experiments across various datasets and LLMs consistently show that our method substantially strengthens TTA by learning effective scaling patterns over adaptation steps and transformer layer projections, improving stability while delivering better performance.",

    "abstract": "Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are increasingly studied as energy-efficient alternatives to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), particularly for edge intelligence. However, prior work has largely emphasized large-scale models, leaving the design and evaluation of lightweight CNN-to-SNN pipelines underexplored. In this paper, we present the first systematic benchmark of lightweight SNNs obtained by converting compact CNN architectures into spiking networks, where activations are modeled with Leaky-Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neurons and trained using surrogate gradient descent under a unified setup. We construct spiking variants of ShuffleNet, SqueezeNet, MnasNet, and MixNet, and evaluate them on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and TinyImageNet, measuring accuracy, F1-score, parameter count, computational complexity, and energy consumption. Our results show that SNNs can achieve up to 15.7x higher energy efficiency than their CNN counterparts while retaining competitive accuracy. Among these, the SNN variant of SqueezeNet consistently outperforms other lightweight SNNs. To further optimize this model, we apply a structured pruning strategy that removes entire redundant modules, yielding a pruned architecture, SNN-SqueezeNet-P. This pruned model improves CIFAR-10 accuracy by 6% and reduces parameters by 19% compared to the original SNN-SqueezeNet. Crucially, it narrows the gap with CNN-SqueezeNet, achieving nearly the same accuracy (only 1% lower) but with an 88.1% reduction in energy consumption due to sparse spike-driven computations. Together, these findings establish lightweight SNNs as practical, low-power alternatives for edge deployment, highlighting a viable path toward deploying high-performance, low-power intelligence on the edge.",

    "abstract": "Computing node importance in networks is a long-standing fundamental problem that has driven extensive study of various centrality measures. A particularly well-known centrality measure is betweenness centrality, which becomes computationally prohibitive on large-scale networks. Graph Neural Network (GNN) models have thus been proposed to predict node rankings according to their relative betweenness centrality. However, state-of-the-art methods fail to generalize to high-diameter graphs such as road networks. We propose BRAVA-GNN, a lightweight GNN architecture that leverages the empirically observed correlation linking betweenness centrality to degree-based quantities, in particular multi-hop degree mass. This correlation motivates the use of degree masses as size-invariant node features and synthetic training graphs that closely match the degree distributions of real networks. Furthermore, while previous work relies on scale-free synthetic graphs, we leverage the hyperbolic random graph model, which reproduces power-law exponents outside the scale-free regime, better capturing the structure of real-world graphs like road networks. This design enables BRAVA-GNN to generalize across diverse graph families while using 54x fewer parameters than the most lightweight existing GNN baseline. Extensive experiments on 19 real-world networks, spanning social, web, email, and road graphs, show that BRAVA-GNN achieves up to 214% improvement in Kendall-Tau correlation and up to 70x speedup in inference time over state-of-the-art GNN-based approaches, particularly on challenging road networks.",

    "abstract": "Rigged 3D assets are fundamental to 3D deformation and animation. However, existing 3D generation methods face challenges in generating animatable geometry, while rigging techniques lack fine-grained structural control over skeleton creation. To address these limitations, we introduce Stroke3D, a novel framework that directly generates rigged meshes from user inputs: 2D drawn strokes and a descriptive text prompt. Our approach pioneers a two-stage pipeline that separates the generation into: 1) Controllable Skeleton Generation, we employ the Skeletal Graph VAE (Sk-VAE) to encode the skeleton's graph structure into a latent space, where the Skeletal Graph DiT (Sk-DiT) generates a skeletal embedding. The generation process is conditioned on both the text for semantics and the 2D strokes for explicit structural control, with the VAE's decoder reconstructing the final high-quality 3D skeleton; and 2) Enhanced Mesh Synthesis via TextuRig and SKA-DPO, where we then synthesize a textured mesh conditioned on the generated skeleton. For this stage, we first enhance an existing skeleton-to-mesh model by augmenting its training data with TextuRig: a dataset of textured and rigged meshes with captions, curated from Objaverse-XL. Additionally, we employ a preference optimization strategy, SKA-DPO, guided by a skeleton-mesh alignment score, to further improve geometric fidelity. Together, our framework enables a more intuitive workflow for creating ready to animate 3D content. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to generate rigged 3D meshes conditioned on user-drawn 2D strokes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Stroke3D produces plausible skeletons and high-quality meshes.",

    "abstract": "Sustaining long-term interactions remains a bottleneck for Large Language Models (LLMs), as their limited context windows struggle to manage dialogue histories that extend over time. Existing memory systems often treat interactions as disjointed snippets, failing to capture the underlying narrative coherence of the dialogue stream. We propose TraceMem, a cognitively-inspired framework that weaves structured, narrative memory schemata from user conversational traces through a three-stage pipeline: (1) Short-term Memory Processing, which employs a deductive topic segmentation approach to demarcate episode boundaries and extract semantic representation; (2) Synaptic Memory Consolidation, a process that summarizes episodes into episodic memories before distilling them alongside semantics into user-specific traces; and (3) Systems Memory Consolidation, which utilizes two-stage hierarchical clustering to organize these traces into coherent, time-evolving narrative threads under unifying themes. These threads are encapsulated into structured user memory cards, forming narrative memory schemata. For memory utilization, we provide an agentic search mechanism to enhance reasoning process. Evaluation on the LoCoMo benchmark shows that TraceMem achieves state-of-the-art performance with a brain-inspired architecture. Analysis shows that by constructing coherent narratives, it surpasses baselines in multi-hop and temporal reasoning, underscoring its essential role in deep narrative comprehension. Additionally, we provide an open discussion on memory systems, offering our perspectives and future outlook on the field.

We learn the joint distribution of PDE parameters and solutions via a diffusion process in a latent space of scaled spectral representations, where Gaussian noise corresponds to functions with controlled regularity. This spectral formulation enables significant dimensionality reduction compared to grid-based diffusion models and ensures that the induced process in function space remains within a class of functions for which the PDE operators are well defined. Building on diffusion posterior sampling, we enforce physics-informed constraints and measurement conditions during inference, applying Adam-based updates at each diffusion step. We evaluate the proposed approach on Poisson, Helmholtz, and incompressible Navier--Stokes equations, demonstrating improved accuracy and computational efficiency compared with existing diffusion-based PDE solvers, which are state of the art for sparse observations.

A frozen promptable segmenter (SAM 2) converts these prompts into high-quality masks.   Within our GenSeg-R1 framework we finetune Qwen3-VL models (4B and 8B parameters) using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), requiring no supervised reasoning-chain annotations.

In machine translation, studies typically report only the translation quality of the student and omit the computational complexity of performing KD, making it difficult to select among the many available KD choices under compute-induced constraints. In this study, we evaluate representative KD methods by considering both translation quality and computational cost. We express computational cost as a carbon footprint using the machine learning life cycle assessment (MLCA) tool. This assessment accounts for runtime operational emissions and amortized hardware production costs throughout the KD model life cycle (teacher training, distillation, and inference). We find that (i) distillation overhead dominates the total footprint at small deployment volumes, (ii) inference dominates at scale, making KD beneficial only beyond a task-dependent usage threshold, and (iii) word-level distillation typically offers more favorable footprint-quality trade-offs than sequence-level distillation. Our protocol provides reproducible guidance for selecting KD methods under explicit quality and compute-induced constraints.",

To address these challenges, we propose a novel prediction-based framework named Contextual and Seasonal LSTMs (CS-LSTMs). CS-LSTMs are built upon a noise decomposition strategy and jointly leverage contextual dependencies and seasonal patterns, thereby strengthening the detection of subtle anomalies. By integrating both time-domain and frequency-domain representations, CS-LSTMs achieve more accurate modeling of periodic trends and anomaly localization.

    "abstract": "Fine-tuning large pre-trained models on a target distribution often improves in-distribution (ID) accuracy, but at the cost of out-of-distribution (OOD) robustness as representations specialize to the fine-tuning data. Weight-space ensembling methods, such as Model Soups, mitigate this effect by averaging multiple checkpoints, but they are computationally prohibitive, requiring the training and storage of dozens of fine-tuned models. In this paper, we introduce MonoSoup, a simple, data-free, hyperparameter-free, post-hoc method that achieves a strong ID-OOD balance using only a single checkpoint. Our method applies Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to each layer's update and decomposes it into high-energy directions that capture task-specific adaptation and low-energy directions that introduce noise but may still encode residual signals useful for robustness. MonoSoup then uses entropy-based effective rank to automatically re-weigh these components with layer-wise coefficients that account for the spectral and geometric structure of the model. Experiments on CLIP models fine-tuned on ImageNet and evaluated under natural distribution shifts, as well as on Qwen language models tested on mathematical reasoning and multiple-choice benchmarks, show that this plug-and-play approach is a practical and effective alternative to multi-checkpoint methods, retaining much of their benefits without their computational overhead.",

    "abstract": "Liver fibrosis poses a substantial challenge in clinical practice, emphasizing the necessity for precise liver segmentation and accurate disease staging. Based on the CARE Liver 2025 Track 4 Challenge, this study introduces a multi-task deep learning framework developed for liver segmentation (LiSeg) and liver fibrosis staging (LiFS) using multiparametric MRI. The LiSeg phase addresses the challenge of limited annotated images and the complexities of multi-parametric MRI data by employing a semi-supervised learning model that integrates image segmentation and registration. By leveraging both labeled and unlabeled data, the model overcomes the difficulties introduced by domain shifts and variations across modalities. In the LiFS phase, we employed a patchbased method which allows the visualization of liver fibrosis stages based on the classification outputs. Our approach effectively handles multimodality imaging data, limited labels, and domain shifts. The proposed method has been tested by the challenge organizer on an independent test set that includes in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) cases using three-channel MRIs (T1, T2, DWI) and seven-channel MRIs (T1, T2, DWI, GED1-GED4).

    "abstract": "In today's connected world, the generation of massive streaming data across diverse domains has become commonplace. In the presence of concept drift, class imbalance, label scarcity, and new class emergence, they jointly degrade representation stability, bias learning toward outdated distributions, and reduce the resilience and reliability of detection in dynamic environments. This paper proposes SCIL (Streaming Class-Incremental Learning) to address these challenges. The SCIL framework integrates an autoencoder (AE) with a multi-layer perceptron for multi-class prediction, uses a dual-loss strategy (classification and reconstruction) for prediction and new class detection, employs corrected pseudo-labels for online training, manages classes with queues, and applies oversampling to handle imbalance. The rationale behind the method's structure is elucidated through ablation studies and a comprehensive experimental evaluation is performed using both real-world and synthetic datasets that feature class imbalance, incremental classes, and concept drifts. Our results demonstrate that SCIL outperforms strong baselines and state-of-the-art methods. Based on our commitment to Open Science, we make our code and datasets available to the community.",

    "abstract": "The transition toward low-inertia power systems demands modeling frameworks that provide not only accurate state predictions but also physically consistent sensitivities for control. While scientific machine learning offers powerful nonlinear modeling tools, the control-oriented implications of different differentiable paradigms remain insufficiently understood. This paper presents a comparative study of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (NODEs), and Differentiable Programming (DP) for modeling, identification, and control of power system dynamics. Using the Single Machine Infinite Bus (SMIB) system as a benchmark, we evaluate their performance in trajectory extrapolation, parameter estimation, and Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) synthesis.   Our results highlight a fundamental trade-off between data-driven flexibility and physical structure. NODE exhibits superior extrapolation by capturing the underlying vector field, whereas PINN shows limited generalization due to its reliance on a time-dependent solution map. In the inverse problem of parameter identification, while both DP and PINN successfully recover the unknown parameters, DP achieves significantly faster convergence by enforcing governing equations as hard constraints. Most importantly, for control synthesis, the DP framework yields closed-loop stability comparable to the theoretical optimum. Furthermore, we demonstrate that NODE serves as a viable data-driven surrogate when governing equations are unavailable.",

    "abstract": "Effectively scaling GUI automation is essential for computer-use agents (CUAs); however, existing work primarily focuses on scaling GUI grounding rather than the more crucial GUI planning, which requires more sophisticated data collection. In reality, the exploration process of a CUA across apps/desktops/web pages typically follows a tree structure, with earlier functional entry points often being explored more frequently. Thus, organizing large-scale trajectories into tree structures can reduce data cost and streamline the data scaling of GUI planning. In this work, we propose TreeCUA to efficiently scale GUI automation with tree-structured verifiable evolution. We propose a multi-agent collaborative framework to explore the environment, verify actions, summarize trajectories, and evaluate quality to generate high-quality and scalable GUI trajectories. To improve efficiency, we devise a novel tree-based topology to store and replay duplicate exploration nodes, and design an adaptive exploration algorithm to balance the depth (\\emph{i.e.}, trajectory difficulty) and breadth (\\emph{i.e.}, trajectory diversity). Moreover, we develop world knowledge guidance and global memory backtracking to avoid low-quality generation. Finally, we naturally extend and propose the TreeCUA-DPO method from abundant tree node information, improving GUI planning capability by referring to the branch information of adjacent trajectories. Experimental results show that TreeCUA and TreeCUA-DPO offer significant improvements, and out-of-domain (OOD) studies further demonstrate strong generalization. All trajectory node information and code will be available at https://github.com/UITron-hub/TreeCUA.",

Existing methods often rely on coarse objectives or unreliable automated judges that are weakly grounded in professional guidelines. We propose a two-stage framework to address this gap. First, we introduce HealthRubrics, a dataset of 7,034 physician-verified preference examples in which clinicians refine LLM-drafted rubrics to meet rigorous medical standards. Second, we distill these rubrics into HealthPrinciples: 119 broadly reusable, clinically grounded principles organized by clinical dimensions, enabling scalable supervision beyond manual annotation. We use HealthPrinciples for (1) offline alignment by synthesizing rubrics for unlabeled queries and (2) an inference-time tool for guided self-revision. A 30B parameter model that activates only 3B parameters at inference trained with our framework achieves 33.4% on HealthBench-Hard, outperforming much larger models including Deepseek-R1 and o3, establishing a resource-efficient baseline for clinical alignment.",

In practice, both domain shift and temporal-sampling shift break correspondence-based propagation and fixed-stride temporal aggregation, causing severe frame-to-frame flicker even in label-stable regions. We propose Time2General, a DGVSS framework built on Stability Queries. Time2General introduces a Spatio-Temporal Memory Decoder that aggregates multi-frame context into a clip-level spatio-temporal memory and decodes temporally consistent per-frame masks without explicit correspondence propagation. To further suppress flicker and improve robustness to varying sampling rates, the Masked Temporal Consistency Loss is proposed to regularize temporal prediction discrepancies across different strides, and randomize training strides to expose the model to diverse temporal gaps. Extensive experiments on multiple driving benchmarks show that Time2General achieves a substantial improvement in cross-domain accuracy and temporal stability over prior DGSS and VSS baselines while running at up to 18 FPS. Code will be released after the review process.",

Assuming that the data distribution has low intrinsic dimensionality, we prove that blind denoising diffusion models (BDDMs), despite not having access to the noise amplitude, \\emph{automatically} track a particular \\emph{implicit} noise schedule along the reverse process. Our analysis shows that BDDMs can accurately sample from the data distribution in polynomially many steps as a function of the intrinsic dimension. Empirical results corroborate these mathematical findings on both synthetic and image data, demonstrating that the noise variance is accurately estimated from the noisy image. Remarkably, we observe that schedule-free BDDMs produce samples of higher quality compared to their non-blind counterparts. We provide evidence that this performance gain arises because BDDMs correct the mismatch between the true residual noise (of the image) and the noise assumed by the schedule used in non-blind diffusion models.",

Previous research primarily focused on learning affordance knowledge from static cues such as language and images, which struggle to provide sufficient dynamic interaction context that can reveal temporal and causal cues. To alleviate this predicament, we collect a comprehensive video-based 3D affordance dataset, \\textit{VIDA}, which contains 38K human-object-interaction videos covering 16 affordance types, 38 object categories, and 22K point clouds. Based on \\textit{VIDA}, we propose a strong baseline: VideoAfford, which activates multimodal large language models with additional affordance segmentation capabilities, enabling both world knowledge reasoning and fine-grained affordance grounding within a unified framework. To enhance action understanding capability, we leverage a latent action encoder to extract dynamic interaction priors from HOI videos. Moreover, we introduce a \\textit{spatial-aware} loss function to enable VideoAfford to obtain comprehensive 3D spatial knowledge. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that our model significantly outperforms well-established methods and exhibits strong open-world generalization with affordance reasoning abilities.

Conventional FS methods such as Extra Trees, Variance Threshold, Tree-based models, Chi-Squared tests, ANOVA, Random Selection, and Sequential Attention rely primarily on statistical heuristics or model-driven importance scores, often overlooking the semantic context of features. Motivated by recent progress in LLM-driven FS, we investigate whether large language models (LLMs) can guide feature selection in a zero-shot setting, using only feature names and task descriptions, as a viable alternative to traditional approaches. We evaluate multiple LLMs (GPT-5.0, GPT-4.0, Gemini-2.5 etc.) on the EMBOD dataset (a fusion of EMBER and BODMAS benchmark datasets), comparing them against established FS methods across several classifiers, including Random Forest, Extra Trees, MLP, and KNN. Performance is assessed using accuracy, precision, recall, F1, AUC, MCC, and runtime. Our results demonstrate that LLM-guided zero-shot feature selection achieves competitive performance with traditional FS methods while offering additional advantages in interpretability, stability, and reduced dependence on labeled data. These findings position zero-shot LLM-based FS as a promising alternative strategy for effective and interpretable malware detection, paving the way for knowledge-guided feature selection in security-critical applications",

With task-specific prompts from best candidate selection, summarization and image captioning to dialogue, MILE-RefHumEval provides flexible, interpretable, and scalable assessments. Experiments show it aligns closely with human judgments, outperforms prior methods, and reduces computational overhead, offering an efficient, robust, and human-aligned solution for real-world LLM evaluation.",

    "abstract": "Constraint Answer Set Programming (CASP) is a hybrid paradigm that enriches Answer Set Programming (ASP) with numerical constraint processing, something required in many real-world applications. The usual specification of constraints in most CASP solvers is closer to the numerical back-end expressiveness and semantics, rather than to standard specification in ASP. In the latter, numerical attributes are represented with predicates and this allows declaring default values, leaving the attribute undefined, making non-deterministic assignments with choice rules or using aggregated values. In CASP, most (if not all) of these features are lost once we switch to a constraint-based representation of those same attributes. In this paper, we present the FLINGO language (and tool) that incorporates the aforementioned expressiveness inside the numerical constraints and we illustrate its use with several examples. Based on previous work that established its semantic foundations, we also present a translation from the newly introduced FLINGO syntax to regular CASP programs following the CLINGCON input format.",

    "abstract": "Watermarking has emerged as a pivotal solution for content traceability and intellectual property protection in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). However, vision-agnostic watermarks may introduce visually irrelevant tokens and disrupt visual grounding by enforcing indiscriminate pseudo-random biases. Additionally, current vision-specific watermarks rely on a static, one-time estimation of vision critical weights and ignore the weight distribution density when determining the proportion of protected tokens. This design fails to account for dynamic changes in visual dependence during generation and may introduce low-quality tokens in the long tail. To address these challenges, we propose Attention-Guided Dynamic Watermarking (AGMark), a novel framework that embeds detectable signals while strictly preserving visual fidelity. At each decoding step, AGMark first dynamically identifies semantic-critical evidence based on attention weights for visual relevance, together with context-aware coherence cues, resulting in a more adaptive and well-calibrated evidence-weight distribution. It then determines the proportion of semantic-critical tokens by jointly considering uncertainty awareness (token entropy) and evidence calibration (weight density), thereby enabling adaptive vocabulary partitioning to avoid irrelevant tokens. Empirical results confirm that AGMark outperforms conventional methods, observably improving generation quality and yielding particularly strong gains in visual semantic fidelity in the later stages of generation. The framework maintains highly competitive detection accuracy (at least 99.36\\% AUC) and robust attack resilience (at least 88.61\\% AUC) without sacrificing inference efficiency, effectively establishing a new standard for reliability-preserving multi-modal watermarking.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in diffusion-based video generation have substantially improved visual fidelity and temporal coherence. However, most existing approaches remain task-specific and rely primarily on textual instructions, limiting their ability to handle multimodal inputs, contextual references, and diverse video generation and editing scenarios within a unified framework. Moreover, many video editing methods depend on carefully engineered pipelines tailored to individual operations, which hinders scalability and composability. In this paper, we propose Tele-Omni, a unified multimodal framework for video generation and editing that follows multimodal instructions, including text, images, and reference videos, within a single model. Tele-Omni leverages pretrained multimodal large language models to parse heterogeneous instructions and infer structured generation or editing intents, while diffusion-based generators perform high-quality video synthesis conditioned on these structured signals. To enable joint training across heterogeneous video tasks, we introduce a task-aware data processing pipeline that unifies multimodal inputs into a structured instruction format while preserving task-specific constraints. Tele-Omni supports a wide range of video-centric tasks, including text-to-video generation, image-to-video generation, first-last-frame video generation, in-context video generation, and in-context video editing. By decoupling instruction parsing from video synthesis and combining it with task-aware data design, Tele-Omni achieves flexible multimodal control while maintaining strong temporal coherence and visual consistency. Experimental results demonstrate that Tele-Omni achieves competitive performance across multiple tasks.",

We study egocentric interaction generation from a single scene image under free-space hand gestures, aiming to synthesize photorealistic videos in which hands enter the scene, interact with objects, and induce plausible world dynamics under head motion. This setting introduces fundamental challenges, including distribution shift between free-space gestures and contact-heavy training data, ambiguity between hand motion and camera motion in monocular views, and the need for arbitrary-length video generation. We present Hand2World, a unified autoregressive framework that addresses these challenges through occlusion-invariant hand conditioning based on projected 3D hand meshes, allowing visibility and occlusion to be inferred from scene context rather than encoded in the control signal. To stabilize egocentric viewpoint changes, we inject explicit camera geometry via per-pixel Plücker-ray embeddings, disentangling camera motion from hand motion and preventing background drift. We further develop a fully automated monocular annotation pipeline and distill a bidirectional diffusion model into a causal generator, enabling arbitrary-length synthesis. Experiments on three egocentric interaction benchmarks show substantial improvements in perceptual quality and 3D consistency while supporting camera control and long-horizon interactive generation.",

In long-horizon TIR trajectories, an early irrecoverable mistake can determine success or failure, making it crucial to localize the first irrecoverable step and leverage it for fine-grained credit assignment. We propose Error-Localized Policy Optimization (ELPO), which localizes the first irrecoverable step via binary-search rollout trees under a fixed rollout budget, converts the resulting tree into stable learning signals through hierarchical advantage attribution, and applies error-localized adaptive clipping to strengthen corrective updates on the critical step and its suffix. Across TIR benchmarks in math, science QA, and code execution, ELPO consistently outperforms strong Agentic RL baselines under comparable sampling budgets, with additional gains in Pass@K and Major@K scaling, rollout ranking quality, and tool-call efficiency. Our code will be publicly released soon.",

    "abstract": "Correctly detecting radar targets is usually challenged by clutter and waveform distortion. An additional difficulty stems from the relative proximity of several targets, the latter being perceived as a single target in the worst case, or influencing each other's detection thresholds. The negative impact of targets proximity notably depends on the range resolution defined by the radar parameters and the adaptive threshold adopted. This paper addresses the matter of targets detection in radar range profiles containing multiple targets with varying proximity and distorted echoes. Inspired by recent contributions in the radar and signal processing literature, this work proposes partially complex-valued neural networks as an adaptive range profile processing. Simulated datasets are generated and experiments are conducted to compare a common pulse compression approach with a simple neural network partially defined by complex-valued parameters. Whereas the pulse compression processes one pulse length at a time, the neural network put forward is a generative architecture going through the entire received signal in one go to generate a complete detection profile.",

We first introduce a domain-agnostic formulation that enables consistent detection and evaluation of the counterintuitive phenomenon, addressing the absence of precise definition. Through extensive experiments on 47 tabular datasets and 10 CV/NLP embedding datasets in ADBench, benchmarked against 13 baseline models, we demonstrate that the phenomenon, as defined, is consistently rare in general tabular data. We further investigate this phenomenon from both theoretical and empirical perspectives, focusing on the roles of data dimensionality and difference in feature correlation. Our results suggest that likelihood-only detection with normalizing flows offers a practical and reliable approach for anomaly detection in tabular domains.",

    "abstract": "A challenge in mitigating social bias in fine-tuned language models (LMs) is the potential reduction in language modeling capability, which can harm downstream performance. Counterfactual data augmentation (CDA), a widely used method for fine-tuning, highlights this issue by generating synthetic data that may align poorly with real-world distributions or creating overly simplistic counterfactuals that ignore the social context of altered sensitive attributes (e.g., gender) in the pretraining corpus. To address these limitations, we propose a simple yet effective context-augmented CDA method, Context-CDA, which uses large LMs to enhance the diversity and contextual relevance of the debiasing corpus. By minimizing discrepancies between the debiasing corpus and pretraining data through augmented context, this approach ensures better alignment, enhancing language modeling capability. We then employ uncertainty-based filtering to exclude generated counterfactuals considered low-quality by the target smaller LMs (i.e., LMs to be debiased), further improving the fine-tuning corpus quality. Experimental results on gender bias benchmarks demonstrate that Context-CDA effectively mitigates bias without sacrificing language modeling performance while offering insights into social biases by analyzing distribution shifts in next-token generation probabilities.",

The vast majority of approaches to spectral clustering are driven by a single modality, leaving the rich information in multi-modal representations untapped. Inspired by the recent success of vision-language pre-training, this paper enriches the landscape of spectral clustering from a single-modal to a multi-modal regime. Particularly, we propose Neural Tangent Kernel Spectral Clustering that leverages cross-modal alignment in pre-trained vision-language models. By anchoring the neural tangent kernel with positive nouns, i.e., those semantically close to the images of interest, we arrive at formulating the affinity between images as a coupling of their visual proximity and semantic overlap. We show that this formulation amplifies within-cluster connections while suppressing spurious ones across clusters, hence encouraging block-diagonal structures. In addition, we present a regularized affinity diffusion mechanism that adaptively ensembles affinity matrices induced by different prompts. Extensive experiments on \\textbf{16} benchmarks -- including classical, large-scale, fine-grained and domain-shifted datasets -- manifest that our method consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art by a large margin.",

    "abstract": "Deep generative models that can tractably compute input likelihoods, including normalizing flows, often assign unexpectedly high likelihoods to out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs. We mitigate this likelihood paradox by manipulating input entropy based on semantic similarity, applying stronger perturbations to inputs that are less similar to an in-distribution memory bank. We provide a theoretical analysis showing that entropy control increases the expected log-likelihood gap between in-distribution and OOD samples in favor of the in-distribution, and we explain why the procedure works without any additional training of the density model. We then evaluate our method against likelihood-based OOD detectors on standard benchmarks and find consistent AUROC improvements over baselines, supporting our explanation.",

    "abstract": "Despite algorithm-level innovations for multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), the underlying networked infrastructure for large-scale MARL training remains underexplored. Existing training frameworks primarily optimize for single-agent scenarios and fail to address the unique system-level challenges of MARL, including rollout-training synchronization barriers, rollout load imbalance, and training resource underutilization. To bridge this gap, we propose FlexMARL, the first end-to-end training framework that holistically optimizes rollout, training, and their orchestration for large-scale LLM-based MARL. Specifically, FlexMARL introduces the joint orchestrator to manage data flow under the rollout-training disaggregated architecture. Building upon the experience store, a novel micro-batch driven asynchronous pipeline eliminates the synchronization barriers while providing strong consistency guarantees. Rollout engine adopts a parallel sampling scheme combined with hierarchical load balancing, which adapts to skewed inter/intra-agent request patterns. Training engine achieves on-demand hardware binding through agent-centric resource allocation. The training states of different agents are swapped via unified and location-agnostic communication. Empirical results on a large-scale production cluster demonstrate that FlexMARL achieves up to 7.3x speedup and improves hardware utilization by up to 5.6x compared to existing frameworks.",

We propose {Budget-Guided MCTS} (BG-MCTS), a tree-search decoding algorithm that aligns its search policy with the remaining token budget: it starts with broad exploration, then prioritizes refinement and answer completion as the budget depletes while reducing late-stage branching from shallow nodes.

Yet, their deployment in multilingual legal settings is constrained by unreliable retrieval and the lack of domain-adapted, open-embedding models. In particular, existing multilingual legal corpora are not designed for semantic retrieval, and PDF-based legislative sources introduce substantial noise due to imperfect text extraction. To address these challenges, we introduce LEMUR, a large-scale multilingual corpus of EU environmental legislation constructed from 24,953 official EUR-Lex PDF documents covering 25 languages. We quantify the fidelity of PDF-to-text conversion by measuring lexical consistency against authoritative HTML versions using the Lexical Content Score (LCS). Building on LEMUR, we fine-tune three state-of-the-art multilingual embedding models using contrastive objectives in both monolingual and bilingual settings, reflecting realistic legal-retrieval scenarios. Experiments across low- and high-resource languages demonstrate that legal-domain fine-tuning consistently improves Top-k retrieval accuracy relative to strong baselines, with particularly pronounced gains for low-resource languages. Cross-lingual evaluations show that these improvements transfer to unseen languages, indicating that fine-tuning primarily enhances language-independent, content-level legal representations rather than language-specific cues.

    "abstract": "Deep learning has achieved expert-level performance in automated electrocardiogram (ECG) diagnosis, yet the \"black-box\" nature of these models hinders their clinical deployment. Trust in medical AI requires not just high accuracy but also transparency regarding the specific physiological features driving predictions. Existing explainability methods for ECGs typically rely on post-hoc approximations (e.g., Grad-CAM and SHAP), which can be unstable, computationally expensive, and unfaithful to the model's actual decision-making process. In this work, we propose the ECG-IMN, an Interpretable Mesomorphic Neural Network tailored for high-resolution 12-lead ECG classification. Unlike standard classifiers, the ECG-IMN functions as a hypernetwork: a deep convolutional backbone generates the parameters of a strictly linear model specific to each input sample. This architecture enforces intrinsic interpretability, as the decision logic is mathematically transparent and the generated weights (W) serve as exact, high-resolution feature attribution maps. We introduce a transition decoder that effectively maps latent features to sample-wise weights, enabling precise localization of pathological evidence (e.g., ST-elevation, T-wave inversion) in both time and lead dimensions. We evaluate our approach on the PTB-XL dataset for classification tasks, demonstrating that the ECG-IMN achieves competitive predictive performance (AUROC comparable to black-box baselines) while providing faithful, instance-specific explanations. By explicitly decoupling parameter generation from prediction execution, our framework bridges the gap between deep learning capability and clinical trustworthiness, offering a principled path toward \"white-box\" cardiac diagnostics.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in block diffusion language models have demonstrated competitive performance and strong scalability on reasoning tasks. However, existing BDLMs have limited exploration under the test-time scaling setting and face more severe decoding challenges in long Chain-of-Thought reasoning, particularly in balancing the decoding speed and effectiveness. In this work, we propose a unified framework for test-time scaling in BDLMs that introduces adaptivity in both decoding and block-wise generation. At the decoding level, we propose Bounded Adaptive Confidence Decoding (BACD), a difficulty-aware sampling strategy that dynamically adjusts denoising based on model confidence, accelerating inference while controlling error accumulation. Beyond step-wise adaptivity, we introduce Think Coarse, Critic Fine (TCCF), a test-time scaling paradigm that allocates large block sizes to exploratory reasoning and smaller block sizes to refinement, achieving an effective efficiency-effectiveness balance. To enable efficient and effective decoding with a large block size, we adopt Progressive Block Size Extension, which mitigates performance degradation when scaling block sizes. Extensive experiments show that applying BACD and TCCF to TDAR-8B yields significant improvements over strong baselines such as TraDo-8B (2.26x speedup, +11.2 points on AIME24). These results mark an important step toward unlocking the potential of BDLMs for test-time scaling in complex reasoning tasks.",

    "abstract": "Conversational question answering increasingly relies on retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to ground large language models (LLMs) in external knowledge. Yet, most existing studies evaluate RAG methods in isolation and primarily focus on single-turn settings. This paper addresses the lack of a systematic comparison of RAG methods for multi-turn conversational QA, where dialogue history, coreference, and shifting user intent substantially complicate retrieval. We present a comprehensive empirical study of vanilla and advanced RAG methods across eight diverse conversational QA datasets spanning multiple domains. Using a unified experimental setup, we evaluate retrieval quality and answer generation using generator and retrieval metrics, and analyze how performance evolves across conversation turns. Our results show that robust yet straightforward methods, such as reranking, hybrid BM25, and HyDE, consistently outperform vanilla RAG. In contrast, several advanced techniques fail to yield gains and can even degrade performance below the No-RAG baseline. We further demonstrate that dataset characteristics and dialogue length strongly influence retrieval effectiveness, explaining why no single RAG strategy dominates across settings. Overall, our findings indicate that effective conversational RAG depends less on method complexity than on alignment between the retrieval strategy and the dataset structure.

To address this, we propose \\textbf{Scalpel}, a method that reduces hallucination by refining attention activation distributions toward more credible regions. Scalpel predicts trusted attention directions for each head in Transformer layers during inference and adjusts activations accordingly. It employs a Gaussian mixture model to capture multi-peak distributions of attention in trust and hallucination manifolds, and uses entropic optimal transport (equivalent to Schrödinger bridge problem) to map Gaussian components precisely. During mitigation, Scalpel dynamically adjusts intervention strength and direction based on component membership and mapping relationships between hallucination and trust activations. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets and benchmarks demonstrate that Scalpel effectively mitigates hallucinations, outperforming previous methods and achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Among existing methods, guiding the generation of frozen LLMs through autoregressive reward models (ARMs) to accomplish multi-objective test-time alignment is a low-cost solution. However, these methods typically rely on independent parameters for each preference objective, either by training ARMs independently across preference dimensions, which neglects interactions among preference features, or by training a single ARM with separate feature extraction modules for each preference, which can cause feature entanglement. Both strategies can result in misalignment between generated outputs and user preferences. To address this limitation, we propose Preference-Modulated \\& Shared Low-Rank Adaptation (MoSLoRA) for ARM training, which first extracts shared features via a preference-agnostic module and then applies affine transformations to shared features via a preference modulation module conditioned on mixed preference vectors. This design mitigates feature entanglement and enables precise control over preference trade-offs during inference. Building on this, we introduce the Unified Autoregressive Reward Model (UniARM), a novel framework for multi-objective test-time alignment. UniARM jointly models all preference dimensions in a single parameter space, eliminating the need for independent parameters for each preference objective. es on larger-scale LLMs, enhancing its practical usability.",

    "abstract": "Realistic talking-head video generation is critical for virtual avatars, film production, and interactive systems. Current methods struggle with nuanced emotional expressions due to the lack of fine-grained emotion control. To address this issue, we introduce a novel two-stage method (AUHead) to disentangle fine-grained emotion control, i.e. , Action Units (AUs), from audio and achieve controllable generation. In the first stage, we explore the AU generation abilities of large audio-language models (ALMs), by spatial-temporal AU tokenization and an \"emotion-then-AU\" chain-of-thought mechanism. It aims to disentangle AUs from raw speech, effectively capturing subtle emotional cues. In the second stage, we propose an AU-driven controllable diffusion model that synthesizes realistic talking-head videos conditioned on AU sequences. Specifically, we first map the AU sequences into the structured 2D facial representation to enhance spatial fidelity, and then model the AU-vision interaction within cross-attention modules. To achieve flexible AU-quality trade-off control, we introduce an AU disentanglement guidance strategy during inference, further refining the emotional expressiveness and identity consistency of the generated videos. Results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves competitive performance in emotional realism, accurate lip synchronization, and visual coherence, significantly surpassing existing techniques.

    "abstract": "Direct preference optimization (DPO) has emerged as a promising approach for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. However, the widespread reliance on the response-level Bradley-Terry (BT) model may limit its full potential, as the reference and learnable models are assumed to be autoregressive only after deriving the objective function. Motivated by this limitation, we revisit the theoretical foundations of DPO and propose a novel formulation that explicitly introduces the autoregressive assumption prior to applying the BT model. By reformulating and extending DPO, we derive a novel variant, termed Autoregressive DPO (ADPO), that explicitly integrates autoregressive modeling into the preference optimization framework. Without violating the theoretical foundations, the derived loss takes an elegant form: it shifts the summation operation in the DPO objective outside the log-sigmoid function. Furthermore, through theoretical analysis of ADPO, we show that there exist two length measures to be considered when designing DPO-based algorithms: the token length $μ$ and the feedback length $μ$'. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to explicitly distinguish these two measures and analyze their implications for preference optimization in LLMs.",

    "abstract": "Monocular Metric Depth Estimation (MMDE) is essential for physically intelligent systems, yet accurate depth estimation for underrepresented classes in complex scenes remains a persistent challenge. To address this, we propose RAD, a retrieval-augmented framework that approximates the benefits of multi-view stereo by utilizing retrieved neighbors as structural geometric proxies. Our method first employs an uncertainty-aware retrieval mechanism to identify low-confidence regions in the input and retrieve RGB-D context samples containing semantically similar content. We then process both the input and retrieved context via a dual-stream network and fuse them using a matched cross-attention module, which transfers geometric information only at reliable point correspondences. Evaluations on NYU Depth v2, KITTI, and Cityscapes demonstrate that RAD significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on underrepresented classes, reducing relative absolute error by 29.2% on NYU Depth v2, 13.3% on KITTI, and 7.2% on Cityscapes, while maintaining competitive performance on standard in-domain benchmarks.",

    "abstract": "Blind Image Quality Assessment, aiming to replicate human perception of visual quality without reference, plays a key role in vision tasks, yet existing models often fail to effectively capture subtle distortion cues, leading to a misalignment with human subjective judgments. We identify that the root cause of this limitation lies in the lack of reliable distortion priors, as methods typically learn shallow relationships between unified image features and quality scores, resulting in their insensitive nature to distortions and thus limiting their performance. To address this, we introduce DR.Experts, a novel prior-driven BIQA framework designed to explicitly incorporate distortion priors, enabling a reliable quality assessment. DR.Experts begins by leveraging a degradation-aware vision-language model to obtain distortion-specific priors, which are further refined and enhanced by the proposed Distortion-Saliency Differential Module through distinguishing them from semantic attentions, thereby ensuring the genuine representations of distortions. The refined priors, along with semantics and bridging representation, are then fused by a proposed mixture-of-experts style module named the Dynamic Distortion Weighting Module. This mechanism weights each distortion-specific feature as per its perceptual impact, ensuring that the final quality prediction aligns with human perception. Extensive experiments conducted on five challenging BIQA benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of DR.Experts over current methods and showcase its excellence in terms of generalization and data efficiency.",

    "abstract": "We introduce AutoSpec, a neural network framework for discovering iterative spectral algorithms for large-scale numerical linear algebra and numerical optimization. Our self-supervised models adapt to input operators using coarse spectral information (e.g., eigenvalue estimates and residual norms), and they predict recurrence coefficients for computing or applying a matrix polynomial tailored to a downstream task. The effectiveness of AutoSpec relies on three ingredients: an architecture whose inference pass implements short, executable numerical linear algebra recurrences; efficient training on small synthetic problems with transfer to large-scale real-world operators; and task-defined objectives that enforce the desired approximation or preconditioning behavior across the range of spectral profiles represented in the training set. We apply AutoSpec to discovering algorithms for representative numerical linear algebra tasks: accelerating matrix-function approximation; accelerating sparse linear solvers; and spectral filtering/preconditioning for eigenvalue computations. On real-world matrices, the learned procedures deliver orders-of-magnitude improvements in accuracy and/or reductions in iteration count, relative to basic baselines. We also find clear connections to classical theory: the induced polynomials often exhibit near-equiripple, near-minimax behavior characteristic of Chebyshev polynomials.",

This paper presents SCA-Net, an enhanced architecture built upon the Change-Agent framework for precise building and road change detection in bi-temporal images. Our model incorporates several key innovations: a novel Difference Pyramid Block for multi-scale change analysis, an Adaptive Multi-scale Processing module combining shape-aware and high-resolution enhancement blocks, and multi-level attention mechanisms (PPM and CSAGate) for joint contextual and detail processing. Furthermore, a dynamic composite loss function and a four-phase training strategy are introduced to stabilize training and accelerate convergence. Comprehensive evaluations on the LEVIR-CD and LEVIR-MCI datasets demonstrate SCA-Net's superior performance over Change-Agent and other state-of-the-art methods. Our approach achieves a significant 2.64% improvement in mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) on LEVIR-MCI and a remarkable 57.9% increase in IoU for small buildings, while reducing the training time by 61%.

However, their use in high-stakes fields like healthcare remains limited due to persistent hallucinations, where generated text contradicts or ignores visual input. We contend that MLLMs can comprehend images but struggle to produce accurate token sequences. Minor perturbations can shift attention from truthful to untruthful states, and the autoregressive nature of text generation often prevents error correction. To address this, we propose SchröMind-a novel framework reducing hallucinations via solving the Schrödinger bridge problem. It establishes a token-level mapping between hallucinatory and truthful activations with minimal transport cost through lightweight training, while preserving the model's original capabilities. Extensive experiments on the POPE and MME benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of Schrödinger, which achieves state-of-the-art performance while introducing only minimal computational overhead.",

In this paper, we propose HLGFA, a high-low resolution guided feature alignment framework that learns normality by modeling cross-resolution feature consistency between high-resolution and low-resolution representations of normal samples, instead of relying on pixel-level reconstruction. Dual-resolution inputs are processed by a shared frozen backbone to extract multi-level features, and high-resolution representations are decomposed into structure and detail priors to guide the refinement of low-resolution features through conditional modulation and gated residual correction. During inference, anomalies are naturally identified as regions where cross-resolution alignment breaks down. In addition, a noise-aware data augmentation strategy is introduced to suppress nuisance-induced responses commonly observed in industrial environments. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of HLGFA, achieving 97.9% pixel-level AUROC and 97.5% image-level AUROC on the MVTec AD dataset, outperforming representative reconstruction-based and feature-based methods.",

Recent advances in multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have significantly propelled the field of computational pathology. However, their application in cytopathology, particularly cervical cytology, remains underexplored, primarily due to the scarcity of large-scale, high-quality annotated datasets. To bridge this gap, we first develop a novel three-stage pipeline to synthesize a million-scale image-description dataset. The pipeline leverages multiple general-purpose MLLMs as weak annotators, refines their outputs through consensus fusion and expert knowledge injection, and produces high-fidelity descriptions of cell morphology. Using this dataset, we then fine-tune the Qwen3-VL-4B model via a multi-stage strategy to create a specialized cytopathology MLLM. The resulting model, named Singpath-VL, demonstrates superior performance in fine-grained morphological perception and cell-level diagnostic classification.

    "abstract": "Existing Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) exhibit insufficient visual attention, leading to hallucinations. To alleviate this problem, some previous studies adjust and amplify visual attention. These methods present a limitation that boosting attention for all visual tokens inevitably increases attention to task irrelevant tokens. To tackle this challenge, we propose a training free attentional intervention algorithm to enhance the attention of task-relevant tokens based on the argument that task-relevant tokens generally demonstrate high visual-textual similarities. Specifically, the vision-text cross-attention submatrices, which represent visual-textual correlations, are extracted to construct the reweighting matrices to reallocate attention. Besides, to enhance the contribution of visual tokens, we inject visual attention values into the beam search decoding to identify solutions with higher visual attention. Extensive experiments demonstrate that this method significantly reduces hallucinations across mainstream LVLMs, while preserving the accuracy and coherence of generated content.",

    "abstract": "The Rashomon set captures the collection of models that achieve near-identical empirical performance yet may differ substantially in their decision boundaries. Understanding the differences among these models, i.e., their multiplicity, is recognized as a crucial step toward model transparency, fairness, and robustness, as it reveals decision boundaries instabilities that standard metrics obscure. However, the existing definitions of Rashomon set and multiplicity metrics assume centralized learning and do not extend naturally to decentralized, multi-party settings like Federated Learning (FL). In FL, multiple clients collaboratively train models under a central server's coordination without sharing raw data, which preserves privacy but introduces challenges from heterogeneous client data distribution and communication constraints. In this setting, the choice of a single best model may homogenize predictive behavior across diverse clients, amplify biases, or undermine fairness guarantees. In this work, we provide the first formalization of Rashomon sets in FL.First, we adapt the Rashomon set definition to FL, distinguishing among three perspectives: (I) a global Rashomon set defined over aggregated statistics across all clients, (II) a t-agreement Rashomon set representing the intersection of local Rashomon sets across a fraction t of clients, and (III) individual Rashomon sets specific to each client's local distribution.Second, we show how standard multiplicity metrics can be estimated under FL's privacy constraints. Finally, we introduce a multiplicity-aware FL pipeline and conduct an empirical study on standard FL benchmark datasets. Our results demonstrate that all three proposed federated Rashomon set definitions offer valuable insights, enabling clients to deploy models that better align with their local data, fairness considerations, and practical requirements.",

    "abstract": "Analyzing animal and human behavior has long been a challenging task in computer vision. Early approaches from the 1970s to the 1990s relied on hand-crafted edge detection, segmentation, and low-level features such as color, shape, and texture to locate objects and infer their identities-an inherently ill-posed problem. Behavior analysis in this era typically proceeded by tracking identified objects over time and modeling their trajectories using sparse feature points, which further limited robustness and generalization. A major shift occurred with the introduction of ImageNet by Deng and Li in 2010, which enabled large-scale visual recognition through deep neural networks and effectively served as a comprehensive visual dictionary. This development allowed object recognition to move beyond complex low-level processing toward learned high-level representations. In this work, we follow this paradigm to build a large-scale Universal Action Space (UAS) using existing labeled human-action datasets. We then use this UAS as the foundation for analyzing and categorizing mammalian and chimpanzee behavior datasets.

However, we identify a critical yet underexplored bottleneck in this paradigm, termed Knowledge Integration Decay (KID). Specifically, we observe that as the length of reasoning generated before search grows, models increasingly fail to integrate retrieved evidence into subsequent reasoning steps, limiting performance even when relevant information is available. To address this, we propose Self-Anchored Knowledge Encoding (SAKE), a training-free inference-time strategy designed to stabilize knowledge utilization. By anchoring retrieved knowledge at both the beginning and end of the reasoning process, SAKE prevents it from being overshadowed by prior context, thereby preserving its semantic integrity. Extensive experiments on multi-hop QA and complex reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that SAKE significantly mitigates KID and improves performance, offering a lightweight yet effective solution for knowledge integration in agentic LLMs.",

In this year's edition, the verification pipeline is at the center again with the following tasks: Task 1 on source retrieval for scientific web claims (a follow-up of the 2025 edition), Task 2 on fact-checking numerical and temporal claims, which adds a reasoning component to the 2025 edition, and Task 3, which expands the verification pipeline with generation of full-fact-checking articles. These tasks represent challenging classification and retrieval problems as well as generation challenges at the document and span level, including multilingual settings.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents an Internet of Things (IoT) application that utilizes an AI classifier for fast-object detection using the frame difference method. This method, with its shorter duration, is the most efficient and suitable for fast-object detection in IoT systems, which require energy-efficient applications compared to end-to-end methods. We have implemented this technique on three edge devices: AMD AlveoT M U50, Jetson Orin Nano, and Hailo-8T M AI Accelerator, and four models with artificial neural networks and transformer models. We examined various classes, including birds, cars, trains, and airplanes. Using the frame difference method, the MobileNet model consistently has high accuracy, low latency, and is highly energy-efficient. YOLOX consistently shows the lowest accuracy, lowest latency, and lowest efficiency. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm has improved the average accuracy gain by 28.314%, the average efficiency gain by 3.6 times, and the average latency reduction by 39.305% compared to the end-to-end method. Of all these classes, the faster objects are trains and airplanes. Experiments show that the accuracy percentage for trains and airplanes is lower than other categories. So, in tasks that require fast detection and accurate results, end-to-end methods can be a disaster because they cannot handle fast object detection. To improve computational efficiency, we designed our proposed method as a lightweight detection algorithm. It is well suited for applications in IoT systems, especially those that require fast-moving object detection and higher accuracy.",

We introduce EcoGym, a generalizable benchmark for continuous plan-and-execute decision making in interactive economies. EcoGym comprises three diverse environments: Vending, Freelance, and Operation, implemented in a unified decision-making process with standardized interfaces, and budgeted actions over an effectively unbounded horizon (1000+ steps if 365 day-loops for evaluation). The evaluation of EcoGym is based on business-relevant outcomes (e.g., net worth, income, and DAU), targeting long-term strategic coherence and robustness under partial observability and stochasticity. Experiments across eleven leading LLMs expose a systematic tension: no single model dominates across all three scenarios. Critically, we find that models exhibit significant suboptimality in either high-level strategies or efficient actions executions. EcoGym is released as an open, extensible testbed for transparent long-horizon agent evaluation and for studying controllability-utility trade-offs in realistic economic settings.",

Unlike conventional approaches that directly regress depth values and often exhibit artifacts under severe or unknown degradation, AdaDS capitalizes on the contraction property of Gaussian smoothing: as noise accumulates in the forward process, distributional discrepancies between degraded inputs and their pristine high-quality counterparts diminish, ultimately converging to isotropic Gaussian prior. Leveraging this, AdaDS adaptively selects a starting timestep in the reverse diffusion trajectory based on estimated refinement uncertainty, and subsequently injects tailored noise to position the intermediate sample within the high-probability region of the target posterior distribution. This strategy ensures inherent robustness, enabling generative prior of a pre-trained diffusion model to dominate recovery even when upstream estimations are imperfect. Extensive experiments on real-world and synthetic benchmarks demonstrate AdaDS's superior zero-shot generalization and resilience to diverse degradation patterns compared to state-of-the-art methods.",

However, the inherent capacity gap often limits the performance of student networks. Inspired by the expressiveness of pretrained teacher networks, a compelling research question arises: is there a type of network that can not only inherit the teacher's structure but also maximize the inheritance of its knowledge? Furthermore, how does the performance of such an inheriting network compare to that of student networks, all benefiting from the same teacher network? To further explore this question, we propose InherNet, a neural network inheritance method that performs asymmetric low-rank decomposition on the teacher's weights and reconstructs a lightweight yet expressive network without significant architectural disruption. By leveraging Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) for initialization to ensure the inheritance of principal knowledge, InherNet effectively balances depth, width, and compression efficiency. Experimental results across unimodal and multimodal tasks demonstrate that InherNet achieves higher performance compared to student networks of similar parameter sizes. Our findings reveal a promising direction for future research in efficient model compression beyond traditional distillation.",

Despite strong empirical results, InfoNCE-based objectives introduce inherent conflicts that yield distribution gaps across modalities. In this work, we identify two conflicts in the multimodal regime, both exacerbated as the number of modalities increases: (i) an alignment-uniformity conflict, whereby the repulsion of uniformity undermines pairwise alignment, and (ii) an intra-alignment conflict, where aligning multiple modalities induces competing alignment directions. To address these issues, we propose a principled decoupling of alignment and uniformity for multimodal representations, providing a conflict-free recipe for multimodal learning that simultaneously supports discriminative and generative use cases without task-specific modules. We then provide a theoretical guarantee that our method acts as an efficient proxy for a global Hölder divergence over multiple modality distributions, and thus reduces the distribution gap among modalities. Extensive experiments on retrieval and UnCLIP-style generation demonstrate consistent gains.",

    "abstract": "Contrastive learning (CL) is a predominant technique in image classification, but they showed limited performance with an imbalanced dataset. Recently, several supervised CL methods have been proposed to promote an ideal regular simplex geometric configuration in the representation space-characterized by intra-class feature collapse and uniform inter-class mean spacing, especially for imbalanced datasets. In particular, existing prototype-based methods include class prototypes, as additional samples to consider all classes. However, the existing CL methods suffer from two limitations. First, they do not consider the alignment between the class means/prototypes and classifiers, which could lead to poor generalization. Second, existing prototype-based methods treat prototypes as only one additional sample per class, making their influence depend on the number of class instances in a batch and causing unbalanced contributions across classes. To address these limitations, we propose Equilibrium Contrastive Learning (ECL), a supervised CL framework designed to promote geometric equilibrium, where class features, means, and classifiers are harmoniously balanced under data imbalance. The proposed ECL framework uses two main components. First, ECL promotes the representation geometric equilibrium (i.e., a regular simplex geometry characterized by collapsed class samples and uniformly distributed class means), while balancing the contributions of class-average features and class prototypes. Second, ECL establishes a classifier-class center geometric equilibrium by aligning classifier weights and class prototypes. We ran experiments with three long-tailed datasets, the CIFAR-10(0)-LT, ImageNet-LT, and the two imbalanced medical datasets, the ISIC 2019 and our constructed LCCT dataset. Results show that ECL outperforms existing SOTA supervised CL methods designed for imbalanced classification.",

However, there exist large gaps between their approximate regret bounds and the regret bounds achieved in the convex setting. Moreover, if focusing on projection-free algorithms, which can efficiently handle complex decision sets, they cannot even recover the approximate regret bounds achieved in the centralized setting. In this paper, we first demonstrate that for D-OCSM over general convex decision sets, these two issues can be addressed simultaneously. Furthermore, for D-OCSM over downward-closed decision sets, we show that the second issue can be addressed while significantly alleviating the first issue. Our key techniques are two reductions from D-OCSM to decentralized online convex optimization (D-OCO), which can exploit D-OCO algorithms to improve the approximate regret of D-OCSM in these two cases, respectively.",

While standard MDLM training directly optimizes token prediction (what-to-unmask), inference-time unmasking orders (where-to-unmask) are typically determined by heuristic confidence measures or trained through reinforcement learning with costly on-policy rollouts. To address this, we introduce Gt-Margin, a position-wise score derived from ground-truth tokens, defined as the probability margin between the correct token and its strongest alternative. Gt-Margin yields an oracle unmasking order that prioritizes easier positions first under each partially masked state. We demonstrate that leveraging this oracle unmasking order significantly enhances final generation quality, particularly on logical reasoning benchmarks. Building on this insight, we train a supervised unmasking planner via learning-to-rank to imitate the oracle ordering from masked contexts. The resulting planner integrates into standard MDLM sampling to select where-to-unmask, improving reasoning accuracy without modifying the token prediction model.",

Statistically, it was known that differentially private learning and replicable learning are equivalent and strictly more powerful than SQ-learning. Yet, computationally, all previously known efficient (i.e., polynomial-time) replicable learning algorithms were confined to SQ-learnable tasks or restricted distributions, in contrast to differentially private learning.   Our main contribution is the first computationally efficient replicable algorithm for realizable learning of parities over arbitrary distributions, a task that is known to be hard in the SQ-model, but possible under differential privacy. This result provides the first evidence that efficient replicable learning over general distributions strictly extends efficient SQ-learning, and is closer in power to efficient differentially private learning, despite computational separations between replicability and privacy. Our main building block is a new, efficient, and replicable algorithm that, given a set of vectors, outputs a subspace of their linear span that covers most of them.",

Training-free methods, exemplified by Gaussian Shading, embed watermarks into the initial noise of diffusion models with negligible impact on the quality of generated images. However, extracting this type of watermark typically requires multi-step diffusion inversion to obtain precise initial noise, which is computationally expensive and time-consuming. To address this issue, we propose One-step Inversion (OSI), a significantly faster and more accurate method for extracting Gaussian Shading style watermarks. OSI reformulates watermark extraction as a learnable sign classification problem, which eliminates the need for precise regression of the initial noise. Then, we initialize the OSI model from the diffusion backbone and finetune it on synthesized noise-image pairs with a sign classification objective. In this manner, the OSI model is able to accomplish the watermark extraction efficiently in only one step. Our OSI substantially outperforms the multi-step diffusion inversion method: it is 20x faster, achieves higher extraction accuracy, and doubles the watermark payload capacity. Extensive experiments across diverse schedulers, diffusion backbones, and cryptographic schemes consistently show improvements, demonstrating the generality of our OSI framework.",

Evaluating them requires approximating a large number of conditional expectations, either via Monte Carlo integration or regression. Until recently it has not been possible to fully exploit deep learning for the regression approach, because retraining for each conditional expectation takes too long. Tabular foundation models such as TabPFN overcome this computational hurdle by leveraging in-context learning, so each conditional expectation can be approximated without any re-training. In this paper, we compute Shapley values with multiple variants of TabPFN and compare their performance with state-of-the-art methods on both simulated and real datasets. In most cases, TabPFN yields the best performance; where it does not, it is only marginally worse than the best method, at a fraction of the runtime. We discuss further improvements and how tabular foundation models can be better adapted specifically for conditional Shapley value estimation.",

    "abstract": "Reaction-diffusion (RD) equations underpin pattern formation across chemistry, biology, and physics, yet learning stable operators that forecast their long-term dynamics from data remains challenging. Neural-operator surrogates provide resolution-robust prediction, but autoregressive rollouts can drift due to the accumulation of error, and out-of-distribution (OOD) initial conditions often degrade accuracy. Physics-based numerical residual objectives can regularize operator learning, although they introduce additional assumptions, sensitivity to discretization and loss design, and higher training cost. Here we develop a purely data-driven operator learner with adaptive recurrent training (DDOL-ART) using a robust recurrent strategy with lightweight validation milestones that early-exit unproductive rollout segments and redirect optimization. Trained only on a single in-distribution toroidal Gaussian family over short horizons, DDOL-ART learns one-step operators that remain stable under long rollouts and generalize zero-shot to strong morphology shifts across FitzHugh-Nagumo (FN), Gray-Scott (GS), and Lambda-Omega (LO) systems. Across these benchmarks, DDOL-ART delivers a strong accuracy and cost trade-off. It is several-fold faster than a physics-based numerical-loss operator learner (NLOL) under matched settings, and it remains competitive on both in-distribution stability and OOD robustness. Training-dynamics diagnostics show that adaptivity strengthens the correlation between validation error and OOD test error performance, acting as a feedback controller that limits optimization drift. Our results indicate that feedback-controlled recurrent training of DDOL-ART generates robust flow-map surrogates without PDE residuals, while simultaneously maintaining competitiveness with NLOL at significantly reduced training costs.",

We hypothesize that a generated text span's factuality is correlated with its representational instability across the model's internal layers. Based on this, we propose the CoCoA (Confusion and Consistency Aware) decoder, a novel, training-free decoding algorithm that mitigates hallucinations at inference time by listening to these signals in the middle layers. We propose two metrics to quantify this instability in the middle layers, and use it to penalize outputs that exhibit high internal confusion, thereby steering the model towards more internally consistent and factually grounded outputs. We further propose a self-information gated variant, CoCoA-SIG, that dynamically modulates this penalty to selectively target high-surprise, unstable generations. Extensive experiments on diverse tasks, including question-answering, summarization and code generation demonstrate that CoCoA significantly improves factual correctness across multiple model families (e.g., Llama-3, Qwen-2.5, Mistral). By leveraging model-intrinsic signals, CoCoA offers an effective and broadly applicable method for enhancing the trustworthiness of LLMs at inference time, without requiring any model retraining.",

However, these Long CoTs are often excessively lengthy and contain redundant reasoning steps, which can hinder inference efficiency. Compressing these long CoTs is a natural solution, yet existing approaches face two major challenges: (1) they may compromise the integrity of visual-textual reasoning by removing essential alignment cues, and (2) the compression process lacks explainability, making it difficult to discern which information is critical. To address these problems, we propose XMCC, an eXplainable Multimodal CoT Compressor that formulates compression as a sequential decision-making process optimized via reinforcement learning. XMCC can effectively shorten reasoning trajectories while preserving key reasoning steps and answer correctness, and simultaneously generates natural-language explanations for its compression decisions. Extensive experiments on representative multimodal reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that XMCC not only reduces reasoning length but also provides explainable explanations, validating its effectiveness.",

Knowledge distillation (KD) is a promising solution for compressing these models, but existing methods primarily rely on static next-token alignment, neglecting the dynamic token interactions, which embed essential capabilities for multimodal understanding and generation. To this end, we introduce Align-TI, a novel KD framework designed from the perspective of Token Interactions. Our approach is motivated by the insight that MLLMs rely on two primary interactions: vision-instruction token interactions to extract relevant visual information, and intra-response token interactions for coherent generation. Accordingly, Align-TI introduces two components: IVA enables the student model to imitate the teacher's instruction-relevant visual information extract capability by aligning on salient visual regions. TPA captures the teacher's dynamic generative logic by aligning the sequential token-to-token transition probabilities. Extensive experiments demonstrate Align-TI's superiority. Notably, our approach achieves $2.6\\%$ relative improvement over Vanilla KD, and our distilled Align-TI-2B even outperforms LLaVA-1.5-7B (a much larger MLLM) by $7.0\\%$, establishing a new state-of-the-art distillation framework for training parameter-efficient MLLMs. Code is available at https://github.com/lchen1019/Align-TI.",

However, digital histopathology image analysis faces significant challenges due to the limited training labels, since manually annotating specific regions or small patches cropped from large WSIs requires substantial time and effort. Weakly supervised multiple instance learning (MIL) offers a practical and efficient solution by requiring only bag-level (slide-level) labels, while each bag typically contains multiple instances (patches). Most MIL methods directly use frozen image patch features generated by various image encoders as inputs and primarily focus on feature aggregation. However, feature representation learning for encoder pretraining in MIL settings has largely been neglected.   In our work, we propose a novel feature representation learning framework called weakly supervised contrastive learning (WeakSupCon) that incorporates bag-level label information during training. Our method does not rely on instance-level pseudo-labeling, yet it effectively separates patches with different labels in the feature space. Experimental results demonstrate that the image features generated by our WeakSupCon method lead to improved downstream MIL performance compared to self-supervised contrastive learning approaches in three datasets.

    "abstract": "Synthetic data provide low-cost, accurately annotated samples for geometry-sensitive vision tasks, but appearance and imaging differences between synthetic and real domains cause severe domain shift and degrade downstream performance. Unpaired synthetic-to-real translation can reduce this gap without paired supervision, yet existing methods often face a trade-off between photorealism and structural stability: unconstrained generation may introduce deformation or spurious textures, while overly rigid constraints limit adaptation to real-domain statistics. We propose FD-DB, a frequency-decoupled dual-branch model that separates appearance transfer into low-frequency interpretable editing and high-frequency residual compensation. The interpretable branch predicts physically meaningful editing parameters (white balance, exposure, contrast, saturation, blur, and grain) to build a stable low-frequency appearance base with strong content preservation. The free branch complements fine details through residual generation, and a gated fusion mechanism combines the two branches under explicit frequency constraints to limit low-frequency drift. We further adopt a two-stage training schedule that first stabilizes the editing branch and then releases the residual branch to improve optimization stability. Experiments on the YCB-V dataset show that FD-DB improves real-domain appearance consistency and significantly boosts downstream semantic segmentation performance while preserving geometric and semantic structures.",

We show that pretrained VLMs already encode the knowledge needed to detect artifacts - with the right scaffolding, this capability can be unlocked using only a few hundred labeled examples per artifact category. Our system, ArtifactLens, achieves state-of-the-art on five human artifact benchmarks (the first evaluation across multiple datasets) while requiring orders of magnitude less labeled data. The scaffolding consists of a multi-component architecture with in-context learning and text instruction optimization, with novel improvements to each. Our methods generalize to other artifact types - object morphology, animal anatomy, and entity interactions - and to the distinct task of AIGC detection.",

The first handles arbitrary adversarial steps and achieves regret $\\tilde{O}(H S^Λ\\sqrt{K S A^{Λ+1}})$, where $K$ is the number of episodes, $S$ is the number of state, $A$ is the number of actions and $H$ is the episode's horizon. The second, assuming the adversarial steps are consecutive, improves the dependence on $S$ to $\\tilde{O}(H\\sqrt{K S^{3} A^{Λ+1}})$. We further give a $K^{2/3}$-regret reduction that removes the need to know which steps are the $Λ$ adversarial steps. We also characterize the regret of adversarial MDPs in the \\emph{fully adversarial} setting ($Λ=H-1$) both for full-information and bandit feedback, and provide almost matching upper and lower bounds (slightly strengthen existing lower bounds, and clarify how different feedback structures affect the hardness of learning).",

To address these challenges, we propose SpotAgent, a framework that formalizes geo-localization into an agentic reasoning process that leverages expert-level reasoning to synergize visual interpretation with tool-assisted verification. SpotAgent actively explores and verifies visual cues by leveraging external tools (e.g., web search, maps) through a ReAct diagram. We introduce a 3-stage post-training pipeline starting with a Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) stage for basic alignment, followed by an Agentic Cold Start phase utilizing high-quality trajectories synthesized via a Multi-Agent framework, aiming to instill tool-calling expertise. Subsequently, the model's reasoning capabilities are refined through Reinforcement Learning. We propose a Spatially-Aware Dynamic Filtering strategy to enhance the efficiency of the RL stage by prioritizing learnable samples based on spatial difficulty.

    "abstract": "Increasing penetration of inverter-based resources, flexible loads, and rapidly changing operating conditions make higher-order $N\\!-\\!k$ contingency assessment increasingly important but computationally prohibitive. Exhaustive evaluation of all outage combinations using AC power-flow or ACOPF is infeasible in routine operation. This fact forces operators to rely on heuristic screening methods whose ability to consistently retain all critical contingencies is not formally established. This paper proposes a scalable, state-aware contingency inference framework designed to directly generate high-impact $N\\!-\\!k$ outage scenarios without enumerating the combinatorial contingency space. The framework employs a conditional diffusion model to produce candidate contingencies tailored to the current operating state, while a topology-aware graph neural network trained only on base and $N\\!-\\!1$ cases efficiently constructs high-risk training samples offline. Finally, the framework is developed to provide controllable coverage guarantees for severe contingencies, allowing operators to explicitly manage the risk of missing critical events under limited AC power-flow evaluation budgets. Experiments on IEEE benchmark systems show that, for a given evaluation budget, the proposed approach consistently evaluates higher-severity contingencies than uniform sampling. This allows critical outages to be identified more reliably with reduced computational effort.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances have reformulated diffusion models as deterministic ordinary differential equations (ODEs) through the framework of flow matching, providing a unified formulation for the noise-to-data generative process. Various training-free flow matching approaches have been developed to improve image generation through flow velocity field adjustment, eliminating the need for costly retraining. However, Modifying the velocity field $v$ introduces errors that propagate through the full generation path, whereas adjustments to the latent trajectory $z$ are naturally corrected by the pretrained velocity network, reducing error accumulation. In this paper, we propose two complementary training-free latent-trajectory adjustment approaches based on future and past velocity $v$ and latent trajectory $z$ information that refine the generative path directly in latent space. We propose two training-free trajectory smoothing schemes: \\emph{Look-Ahead}, which averages the current and next-step latents using a curvature-gated weight, and \\emph{Look-Back}, which smoothes latents using an exponential moving average with decay. We demonstrate through extensive experiments and comprehensive evaluation metrics that the proposed training-free trajectory smoothing models substantially outperform various state-of-the-art models across multiple datasets including COCO17, CUB-200, and Flickr30K.",

    "abstract": "Urban Visual Pollution (UVP) has emerged as a critical concern, yet research on automatic detection and application remains fragmented. This scoping review maps the existing deep learning-based approaches for detecting, classifying, and designing a comprehensive application framework for visual pollution management. Following the PRISMA-ScR guidelines, seven academic databases (Scopus, Web of Science, IEEE Xplore, ACM DL, ScienceDirect, SpringerNatureLink, and Wiley) were systematically searched and reviewed, and 26 articles were found. Most research focuses on specific pollutant categories and employs variations of YOLO, Faster R-CNN, and EfficientDet architectures. Although several datasets exist, they are limited to specific areas and lack standardized taxonomies. Few studies integrate detection into real-time application systems, yet they tend to be geographically skewed. We proposed a framework for monitoring visual pollution that integrates a visual pollution index to assess the severity of visual pollution for a certain area. This review highlights the need for a unified UVP management system that incorporates pollutant taxonomy, a cross-city benchmark dataset, a generalized deep learning model, and an assessment index that supports sustainable urban aesthetics and enhances the well-being of urban dwellers.",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in multicultural settings; however, systematic evaluation of cultural specificity at the sentence level remains underexplored. We propose the Conceptual Cultural Index (CCI), which estimates cultural specificity at the sentence level. CCI is defined as the difference between the generality estimate within the target culture and the average generality estimate across other cultures. This formulation enables users to operationally control the scope of culture via comparison settings and provides interpretability, since the score derives from the underlying generality estimates. We validate CCI on 400 sentences (200 culture-specific and 200 general), and the resulting score distribution exhibits the anticipated pattern: higher for culture-specific sentences and lower for general ones. For binary separability, CCI outperforms direct LLM scoring, yielding more than a 10-point improvement in AUC for models specialized to the target culture.

    "abstract": "The transition from symbolic manipulation to science-grade reasoning represents a pivotal frontier for Large Language Models (LLMs), with physics serving as the critical test anchor for binding abstract logic to physical reality. Physics demands that a model maintain physical consistency with the laws governing the universe, a task that fundamentally requires multimodal perception to ground abstract logic in reality. At the Olympiad level, diagrams are often constitutive rather than illustrative, containing essential constraints, such as boundary conditions and spatial symmetries, that are absent from the text. To bridge this visual-logical gap, we introduce P1-VL, a family of open-source vision-language models engineered for advanced scientific reasoning. Our method harmonizes Curriculum Reinforcement Learning, which employs progressive difficulty expansion to stabilize post-training, with Agentic Augmentation, enabling iterative self-verification at inference. Evaluated on HiPhO, a rigorous benchmark of 13 exams from 2024-2025, our flagship P1-VL-235B-A22B becomes the first open-source Vision-Language Model (VLM) to secure 12 gold medals and achieves the state-of-the-art performance in the open-source models. Our agent-augmented system achieves the No.2 overall rank globally, trailing only Gemini-3-Pro. Beyond physics, P1-VL demonstrates remarkable scientific reasoning capacity and generalizability, establishing significant leads over base models in STEM benchmarks. By open-sourcing P1-VL, we provide a foundational step toward general-purpose physical intelligence to better align visual perceptions with abstract physical laws for machine scientific discovery.",

    "abstract": "Social biases inherent in large language models (LLMs) raise significant fairness concerns. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architectures, which retrieve external knowledge sources to enhance the generative capabilities of LLMs, remain susceptible to the same bias-related challenges. This work focuses on evaluating and understanding the social bias implications of RAG. Through extensive experiments across various retrieval corpora, LLMs, and bias evaluation datasets, encompassing more than 13 different bias types, we surprisingly observe a reduction in bias in RAG. This suggests that the inclusion of external context can help counteract stereotype-driven predictions, potentially improving fairness by diversifying the contextual grounding of the model's outputs. To better understand this phenomenon, we then explore the model's reasoning process by integrating Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting into RAG while assessing the faithfulness of the model's CoT. Our experiments reveal that the model's bias inclinations shift between stereotype and anti-stereotype responses as more contextual information is incorporated from the retrieved documents. Interestingly, we find that while CoT enhances accuracy, contrary to the bias reduction observed with RAG, it increases overall bias across datasets, highlighting the need for bias-aware reasoning frameworks that can mitigate this trade-off.",

Despite rapid progress in model architectures and training pipelines, most publicly available fine-tuning datasets suffer from low resolution, poor text-image alignment, or limited diversity, resulting in a clear performance gap between open research models and enterprise-grade models. In this work, we present Fine-T2I, a large-scale, high-quality, and fully open dataset for T2I fine-tuning. Fine-T2I spans 10 task combinations, 32 prompt categories, 11 visual styles, and 5 prompt templates, and combines synthetic images generated by strong modern models with carefully curated real images from professional photographers. All samples are rigorously filtered for text-image alignment, visual fidelity, and prompt quality, with over 95% of initial candidates removed. The final dataset contains over 6 million text-image pairs, around 2 TB on disk, approaching the scale of pretraining datasets while maintaining fine-tuning-level quality. Across a diverse set of pretrained diffusion and autoregressive models, fine-tuning on Fine-T2I consistently improves both generation quality and instruction adherence, as validated by human evaluation, visual comparison, and automatic metrics. We release Fine-T2I under an open license to help close the data gap in T2I fine-tuning in the open community.",

    "abstract": "Self-Consistency (SC) is an effective decoding strategy that improves the reasoning performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) by generating multiple chain-of-thought reasoning paths and selecting the final answer via majority voting. However, it suffers from substantial inference costs because it requires a large number of samples. To mitigate this issue, Difficulty-Adaptive Self-Consistency (DSC) was proposed to reduce unnecessary token usage for easy problems by adjusting the number of samples according to problem difficulty. However, DSC requires additional model calls and pre-sampling to estimate difficulty, and this process is repeated when applying to each dataset, leading to significant computational overhead. In this work, we propose Activation-Informed Difficulty-Aware Self-Consistency (ACTSC) to address these limitations. ACTSC leverages internal difficulty signals reflected in the feed-forward network neuron activations to construct a lightweight difficulty estimation probe, without any additional token generation or model calls. The probe dynamically adjusts the number of samples for SC and can be applied to new datasets without requiring pre-sampling for difficulty estimation. To validate its effectiveness, we conduct experiments on five benchmarks. Experimental results show that ACTSC effectively reduces inference costs while maintaining accuracy relative to existing methods.",

    "abstract": "With the growing interest in foundation models for brain signals, graph-based pretraining has emerged as a promising paradigm for learning transferable representations from connectome data. However, existing contrastive and masked autoencoder methods typically rely on naive random dropping or masking for augmentation, which is ill-suited for brain graphs and hypergraphs as it disrupts semantically meaningful connectivity patterns. Moreover, commonly used graph-level readout and reconstruction schemes fail to capture global structural information, limiting the robustness of learned representations. In this work, we propose a unified diffusion-based pretraining framework that addresses both limitations. First, diffusion is designed to guide structure-aware dropping and masking strategies, preserving brain graph semantics while maintaining effective pretraining diversity. Second, diffusion enables topology-aware graph-level readout and node-level global reconstruction by allowing graph embeddings and masked nodes to aggregate information from globally related regions. Extensive experiments across multiple neuroimaging datasets with over 25,000 subjects and 60,000 scans involving various mental disorders and brain atlases demonstrate consistent performance improvements.",

    "abstract": "Fine-grained truck classification is critical for intelligent transportation systems (ITS), yet current LiDAR-based methods face scalability challenges due to their reliance on supervised deep learning and labor-intensive manual annotation. Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offer promising few-shot generalization, but their application to roadside LiDAR is limited by a modality gap between sparse 3D point clouds and dense 2D imagery. We propose a framework that bridges this gap by adapting off-the-shelf VLMs for fine-grained truck classification without parameter fine-tuning. Our new depth-aware image generation pipeline applies noise removal, spatial and temporal registration, orientation rectification, morphological operations, and anisotropic smoothing to transform sparse, occluded LiDAR scans into depth-encoded 2D visual proxies. Validated on a real-world dataset of 20 vehicle classes, our approach achieves competitive classification accuracy with as few as 16-30 examples per class, offering a scalable alternative to data-intensive supervised baselines. We further observe a \"Semantic Anchor\" effect: text-based guidance regularizes performance in ultra-low-shot regimes $k < 4$, but degrades accuracy in more-shot settings due to semantic mismatch. Furthermore, we demonstrate the efficacy of this framework as a Cold Start strategy, using VLM-generated labels to bootstrap lightweight supervised models. Notably, the few-shot VLM-based model achieves over correct classification rate of 75 percent for specific drayage categories (20ft, 40ft, and 53ft containers) entirely without the costly training or fine-tuning, significantly reducing the intensive demands of initial manual labeling, thus achieving a method of practical use in ITS applications.",

    "abstract": "Discrete diffusion models have recently emerged as a powerful class of generative models for chemistry and biology data. In these fields, the goal is to generate various samples with high rewards (e.g., drug-likeness in molecules), making reward-based guidance crucial. Most existing methods are based on guiding the diffusion model using intermediate rewards but tend to underperform since intermediate rewards are noisy due to the non-smooth nature of reward functions used in scientific domains. To address this, we propose Clean-Sample Markov Chain (CSMC) Sampler, a method that performs effective test-time reward-guided sampling for discrete diffusion models, enabling local search without relying on intermediate rewards. CSMC constructs a Markov chain of clean samples using the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm such that its stationary distribution is the target distribution. We design a proposal distribution by sequentially applying the forward and backward diffusion processes, making the acceptance probability tractable. Experiments on molecule and biological sequence generation with various reward functions demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms prior approaches that rely on intermediate rewards.",

Existing moral benchmarks prompt LLMs with value statements, moral scenarios, or psychological questionnaires, with the implicit underlying assumption that LLMs report somewhat stable moral preferences. However, moral psychology research has shown that human moral judgements are sensitive to morally irrelevant situational factors, such as smelling cinnamon rolls or the level of ambient noise, thereby challenging moral theories that assume the stability of human moral judgements. Here, we draw inspiration from this \"situationist\" view of moral psychology to evaluate whether LLMs exhibit similar cognitive moral biases to humans. We curate a novel multimodal dataset of 60 \"moral distractors\" from existing psychological datasets of emotionally-valenced images and narratives which have no moral relevance to the situation presented. After injecting these distractors into existing moral benchmarks to measure their effects on LLM responses, we find that moral distractors can shift the moral judgements of LLMs by over 30% even in low-ambiguity scenarios, highlighting the need for more contextual moral evaluations and more nuanced cognitive moral modeling of LLMs.",

    "abstract": "We develop an operator-theoretic framework for stability and statistical concentration in nonlinear inverse problems with block-structured parameters. Under a unified set of assumptions combining blockwise Lipschitz geometry, local identifiability, and sub-Gaussian noise, we establish deterministic stability inequalities, global Lipschitz bounds for least-squares misfit functionals, and nonasymptotic concentration estimates. These results yield high-probability parameter error bounds that are intrinsic to the forward operator and independent of any specific reconstruction algorithm. As a concrete instantiation, we verify that the Gaussian Splatting rendering operator satisfies the proposed assumptions and derive explicit constants governing its Lipschitz continuity and resolution-dependent observability. This leads to a fundamental stability--resolution tradeoff, showing that estimation error is inherently constrained by the ratio between image resolution and model complexity. Overall, the analysis characterizes operator-level limits for a broad class of high-dimensional nonlinear inverse problems arising in modern imaging and differentiable rendering.",

    "abstract": "Model merging aims to combine multiple fine-tuned models into a single multi-task model without access to training data. Existing task-vector merging methods such as TIES, TSV-M, and Iso-C/CTS differ in their aggregation rules but treat all layers nearly uniformly. This assumption overlooks the strong layer-wise heterogeneity in large vision transformers, where shallow layers are sensitive to interference while deeper layers encode stable task-specific features. We introduce LARV, a training-free, data-free, merger-agnostic Layer-wise Adaptive Rescaling Veneer that plugs into any task-vector merger and assigns a per-layer scale to each task vector before aggregation, and show it consistently boosts diverse merging rules. LARV adaptively suppresses shallow-layer interference and amplifies deeper-layer alignment using a simple deterministic schedule, requiring no retraining or modification to existing mergers. To our knowledge, this is the first work to perform layer-aware scaling for task-vector merging. LARV computes simple data-free layer proxies and turns them into scales through a lightweight rule; we study several instantiations within one framework (e.g., tiered two/three-level scaling with fixed values, or continuous mappings) and show that tiered choices offer the best robustness, while continuous mappings remain an ablation. LARV is orthogonal to the base merger and adds negligible cost. On FusionBench with Vision Transformers, LARV consistently improves all task-vector baselines across 8/14/20-task settings; for example, Iso-C + LARV reaches 85.9% on ViT-B/32, 89.2% on ViT-B/16, and 92.6% on ViT-L/14. Layerwise analysis and corruption tests further indicate that LARV suppresses shallow-layer interference while modestly amplifying deeper, task-stable features, turning model merging into a robust, layer-aware procedure rather than a uniform one.",

    "abstract": "The rapid development of visual generative models raises the need for more scalable and human-aligned evaluation methods. While the crowdsourced Arena platforms offer human preference assessments by collecting human votes, they are costly and time-consuming, inherently limiting their scalability. Leveraging vision-language model (VLMs) as substitutes for manual judgments presents a promising solution. However, the inherent hallucinations and biases of VLMs hinder alignment with human preferences, thus compromising evaluation reliability. Additionally, the static evaluation approach lead to low efficiency. In this paper, we propose K-Sort Eval, a reliable and efficient VLM-based evaluation framework that integrates posterior correction and dynamic matching. Specifically, we curate a high-quality dataset from thousands of human votes in K-Sort Arena, with each instance containing the outputs and rankings of K models. When evaluating a new model, it undergoes (K+1)-wise free-for-all comparisons with existing models, and the VLM provide the rankings. To enhance alignment and reliability, we propose a posterior correction method, which adaptively corrects the posterior probability in Bayesian updating based on the consistency between the VLM prediction and human supervision. Moreover, we propose a dynamic matching strategy, which balances uncertainty and diversity to maximize the expected benefit of each comparison, thus ensuring more efficient evaluation. Extensive experiments show that K-Sort Eval delivers evaluation results consistent with K-Sort Arena, typically requiring fewer than 90 model runs, demonstrating both its efficiency and reliability.",

    "abstract": "A 3D understanding of anatomy is central to diagnosis and treatment planning, yet volumetric imaging remains costly with long wait times. Image-to-3D foundations models can solve this issue by reconstructing 3D data from 2D modalites. Current foundation models are trained on natural image distributions to reconstruct naturalistic objects from a single image by leveraging geometric priors across pixels. However, it is unclear whether these learned geometric priors transfer to medical data. In this study, we present a controlled zero-shot benchmark of single slice medical image-to-3D reconstruction across five state-of-the-art image-to-3D models: SAM3D, Hunyuan3D-2.1, Direct3D, Hi3DGen, and TripoSG. These are evaluated across six medical datasets spanning anatomical and pathological structures and two natrual datasets, using voxel based metrics and point cloud distance metrics. Across medical datasets, voxel based overlap remains moderate for all models, consistent with a depth reconstruction failure mode when inferring volume from a single slice. In contrast, global distance metrics show more separation between methods: SAM3D achieves the strongest overall topological similarity to ground truth medical 3D data, while alternative models are more prone to over-simplication of reconstruction. Our results quantify the limits of single-slice medical reconstruction and highlight depth ambiguity caused by the planar nature of 2D medical data, motivating multi-view image-to-3D reconstruction to enable reliable medical 3D inference.",

While this minimizes resource usage for on-device applications, it makes agents notoriously sample-inefficient, since value-based losses alone struggle to extract meaningful representations from transient data. We propose extending Self-Predictive Representations (SPR) to the streaming pipeline to maximize the utility of every observed frame. However, due to the highly correlated samples induced by the streaming regime, naively applying this auxiliary loss results in training instabilities. Thus, we introduce orthogonal gradient updates relative to the momentum target and resolve gradient conflicts arising from streaming-specific optimizers. Validated across the Atari, MinAtar, and Octax suites, our approach systematically outperforms existing streaming baselines. Latent-space analysis, including t-SNE visualizations and effective-rank measurements, confirms that our method learns significantly richer representations, bridging the performance gap caused by the absence of a replay buffer, while remaining efficient enough to train on just a few CPU cores.",

However, its extra parameter perturbation step doubles the computation cost, which becomes the bottleneck of SAM in the practical implementation. In this work, we propose an approach SL-SAM to break this bottleneck by introducing the sparse technique to layers. Our key innovation is to frame the dynamic selection of layers for both the gradient ascent (perturbation) and descent (update) steps as a multi-armed bandit problem. At the beginning of each iteration, SL-SAM samples a part of the layers of the model according to the gradient norm to participate in the backpropagation of the following parameter perturbation and update steps, thereby reducing the computation complexity. We then provide the analysis to guarantee the convergence of SL-SAM. In the experiments of fine-tuning models in several tasks, SL-SAM achieves the performances comparable to the state-of-the-art baselines, including a \\#1 rank on LLM fine-tuning. Meanwhile, SL-SAM significantly reduces the ratio of active parameters in backpropagation compared to vanilla SAM (SL-SAM activates 47\\%, 22\\% and 21\\% parameters on the vision, moderate and large language model respectively while vanilla SAM always activates 100\\%), verifying the efficiency of our proposed algorithm.",

To further expand the range of languages these models can support, many works focus on continued pre-training of these models. However, few works address how to extend mPLMs to low-resource languages that were previously unsupported. To tackle this issue, we expand the model's vocabulary using a target language corpus. We then screen out a subset from the model's original vocabulary, which is biased towards representing the source language(e.g. English), and utilize bilingual dictionaries to initialize the representations of the expanded vocabulary. Subsequently, we continue to pre-train the mPLMs using the target language corpus, based on the representations of these expanded vocabulary. Experimental results show that our proposed method outperforms the baseline, which uses randomly initialized expanded vocabulary for continued pre-training, in POS tagging and NER tasks, achieving improvements by 0.54% and 2.60%, respectively. Furthermore, our method demonstrates high robustness in selecting the training corpora, and the models' performance on the source language does not degrade after continued pre-training.",

Predicting words differs from using language in the circumstances of specific transactions and reconstituting common contractual phrases differs from reasoning about the law.

Nevertheless, such exploration is crucial for enhancing the robustness and reliability of evaluations. To bridge this gap, we propose BiasScope, a LLM-driven framework for automatically and at scale discovering potential biases that may arise during model evaluation. BiasScope can uncover potential biases across different model families and scales, with its generality and effectiveness validated on the JudgeBench dataset. It overcomes the limitations of existing approaches, transforming bias discovery from a passive process relying on manual effort and predefined bias lists into an active and comprehensive automated exploration. Moreover, based on BiasScope, we propose JudgeBench-Pro, an extended version of JudgeBench and a more challenging benchmark for evaluating the robustness of LLM-as-a-judge. Strikingly, even powerful LLMs as evaluators show error rates above 50\\% on JudgeBench-Pro, underscoring the urgent need to strengthen evaluation robustness and to mitigate potential biases further.",

    "abstract": "Semi-supervised learning relaxes the need of large pixel-wise labeled datasets for image segmentation by leveraging unlabeled data. The scarcity of high-quality labeled data remains a major challenge in medical image analysis due to the high annotation costs and the need for specialized clinical expertise. Semi-supervised learning has demonstrated significant potential in addressing this bottleneck, with pseudo-labeling and consistency regularization emerging as two predominant paradigms. Dual-task collaborative learning, an emerging consistency-aware paradigm, seeks to derive supplementary supervision by establishing prediction consistency between related tasks. However, current methodologies are limited to unidirectional interaction mechanisms (typically regression-to-segmentation), as segmentation results can only be transformed into regression outputs in an offline manner, thereby failing to fully exploit the potential benefits of online bidirectional cross-task collaboration. Thus, we propose a fully Differentiable Bidirectional Synergistic Learning (DBiSL) framework, which seamlessly integrates and enhances four critical SSL components: supervised learning, consistency regularization, pseudo-supervised learning, and uncertainty estimation. Experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate our method's state-of-the-art performance. Beyond technical contributions, this work provides new insights into unified SSL framework design and establishes a new architectural foundation for dual-task-driven SSL, while offering a generic multitask learning framework applicable to broader computer vision applications.

Using hyperbolic geodesic distance to rule-verified correctness, we define a node potential and assign dense process rewards by potential differences. We further attach a lightweight value head on the same shared latent space, enabling self-guided test-time scaling with almost no additional overhead. On MATH-500, LaPha improves Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B from 66.0% to 88.2%. With value-head-guided search, LaPha-1.5B reaches 56.7% accuracy on AIME'24, and LaPha-7B further achieves 60.0% on AIME'24 and 53.3% on AIME'25.",

    "abstract": "In this work, we present AfriNLLB, a series of lightweight models for efficient translation from and into African languages. AfriNLLB supports 15 language pairs (30 translation directions), including Swahili, Hausa, Yoruba, Amharic, Somali, Zulu, Lingala, Afrikaans, Wolof, and Egyptian Arabic, as well as other African Union official languages such as Arabic (MSA), French, Portuguese, and Spanish. Our training data covers bidirectional translation between English and 13 languages, and between French and two languages (Lingala and Wolof).   AfriNLLB models are based on NLLB-200 600M, which we compress using iterative layer pruning and quantization. We fine-tune the pruned models on parallel corpora we curated for African languages, employing knowledge distillation from a larger teacher model. Our work aims at enabling efficient deployment of translation models for African languages in resource-constrained settings.   Our evaluation results demonstrate that AfriNLLB models achieve performance comparable to the baseline while being significantly faster. We release two versions of the AfriNLLB models, a Transformers version that allows further fine-tuning and a CTranslate2 version for efficient inference. Moreover, we release all the training data that we used for fine-tuning the baseline and pruned models to facilitate further research.",

We propose AgentSkiller, a fully automated framework synthesizing multi-turn interaction data across realistic, semantically linked domains. It employs a DAG-based architecture with explicit state transitions to ensure determinism and recoverability. The pipeline builds a domain ontology and Person-Centric Entity Graph, defines tool interfaces via Service Blueprints for Model Context Protocol servers, and populates environments with consistent databases and strict Domain Policies. A cross-domain fusion mechanism links services to simulate complex tasks. Finally, the pipeline creates user tasks by verifying solution paths, filtering via execution-based validation, and generating queries using a Persona-based Simulator for automated rollout. This produces reliable environments with clear state changes. To demonstrate effectiveness, we synthesized $\\approx$ 11K interaction samples; experimental results indicate that models trained on this dataset achieve significant improvements on function calling over baselines, particularly in larger parameter regimes.",

    "abstract": "Due to the scarcity of part-of-speech annotated data, existing studies on low-resource languages typically adopt unsupervised approaches for POS tagging. Among these, POS tag projection with word alignment method transfers POS tags from a high-resource source language to a low-resource target language based on parallel corpora, making it particularly suitable for low-resource language settings. However, this approach relies heavily on parallel corpora, which are often unavailable for many low-resource languages. To overcome this limitation, we propose a fully unsupervised cross-lingual part-of-speech(POS) tagging framework that relies solely on monolingual corpora by leveraging unsupervised neural machine translation(UNMT) system. This UNMT system first translates sentences from a high-resource language into a low-resource one, thereby constructing pseudo-parallel sentence pairs. Then, we train a POS tagger for the target language following the standard projection procedure based on word alignments. Moreover, we propose a multi-source projection technique to calibrate the projected POS tags on the target side, enhancing to train a more effective POS tagger. We evaluate our framework on 28 language pairs, covering four source languages (English, German, Spanish and French) and seven target languages (Afrikaans, Basque, Finnis, Indonesian, Lithuanian, Portuguese and Turkish). Experimental results show that our method can achieve performance comparable to the baseline cross-lingual POS tagger with parallel sentence pairs, and even exceeds it for certain target languages. Furthermore, our proposed multi-source projection technique further boosts performance, yielding an average improvement of 1.3% over previous methods.",

However, existing benchmarks primarily focus on general domain visual fidelity, leaving the evaluation of state transitions and temporal coherence in GUI-specific contexts underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce GEBench, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating dynamic interaction and temporal coherence in GUI generation. GEBench comprises 700 carefully curated samples spanning five task categories, covering both single-step interactions and multi-step trajectories across real-world and fictional scenarios, as well as grounding point localization. To support systematic evaluation, we propose GE-Score, a novel five-dimensional metric that assesses Goal Achievement, Interaction Logic, Content Consistency, UI Plausibility, and Visual Quality. Extensive evaluations on current models indicate that while they perform well on single-step transitions, they struggle significantly with maintaining temporal coherence and spatial grounding over longer interaction sequences. Our findings identify icon interpretation, text rendering, and localization precision as critical bottlenecks. This work provides a foundation for systematic assessment and suggests promising directions for future research toward building high-fidelity generative GUI environments.

Recent motion modeling techniques are ill-suited to this problem setting. For example, deformation fields cannot introduce new geometry, and 4D Gaussian splatting constrains motion to a linear trajectory in space and time and cannot track the same set of Gaussians over time. Here, we introduce a 3D Gaussian flow field representation that models plant growth as a time-varying derivative over Gaussian parameters -- position, scale, orientation, color, and opacity -- enabling nonlinear and continuous-time growth dynamics. To initialize a sufficient set of Gaussian primitives, we reconstruct the mature plant and learn a process of reverse growth, effectively simulating the plant's developmental history in reverse. Our approach achieves superior image quality and geometric accuracy compared to prior methods on multi-view timelapse datasets of plant growth, providing a new approach for appearance modeling of growing 3D structures.",

    "abstract": "Symbolic regression (SR) aims to discover interpretable analytical expressions that accurately describe observed data. Amortized SR promises to be much more efficient than the predominant genetic programming SR methods, but currently struggles to scale to realistic scientific complexity. We find that a key obstacle is the lack of a fast reduction of equivalent expressions to a concise normalized form. Amortized SR has addressed this by general-purpose Computer Algebra Systems (CAS) like SymPy, but the high computational cost severely limits training and inference speed. We propose SimpliPy, a rule-based simplification engine achieving a 100-fold speed-up over SymPy at comparable quality. This enables substantial improvements in amortized SR, including scalability to much larger training sets, more efficient use of the per-expression token budget, and systematic training set decontamination with respect to equivalent test expressions. We demonstrate these advantages in our Flash-ANSR framework, which achieves much better accuracy than amortized baselines (NeSymReS, E2E) on the FastSRB benchmark. Moreover, it performs on par with state-of-the-art direct optimization (PySR) while recovering more concise instead of more complex expressions with increasing inference budget.",

    "abstract": "Multimodal multiview learning seeks to integrate information from diverse sources to enhance task performance. Existing approaches often struggle with flexible view configurations, including arbitrary view combinations, numbers of views, and heterogeneous modalities. Focusing on the context of human activity recognition, we propose RALIS, a model that combines multiview contrastive learning with a mixture-of-experts module to support arbitrary view availability during both training and inference. Instead of trying to reconstruct missing views, an adjusted center contrastive loss is used for self-supervised representation learning and view alignment, mitigating the impact of missing views on multiview fusion. This loss formulation allows for the integration of view weights to account for view quality. Additionally, it reduces computational complexity from $O(V^2)$ to $O(V)$, where $V$ is the number of views. To address residual discrepancies not captured by contrastive learning, we employ a mixture-of-experts module with a specialized load balancing strategy, tasked with adapting to arbitrary view combinations. We highlight the geometric relationship among components in our model and how they combine well in the latent space. RALIS is validated on four datasets encompassing inertial and human pose modalities, with the number of views ranging from three to nine, demonstrating its performance and flexibility.",

However, existing flow-based editors predominantly support global or single-instruction edits and struggle with multi-instance scenarios, where multiple parts of a reference input must be edited independently without semantic interference. We identify this limitation as a consequence of globally conditioned velocity fields and joint attention mechanisms, which entangle concurrent edits. To address this issue, we introduce Instance-Disentangled Attention, a mechanism that partitions joint attention operations, enforcing binding between instance-specific textual instructions and spatial regions during velocity field estimation. We evaluate our approach on both natural image editing and a newly introduced benchmark of text-dense infographics with region-level editing instructions. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach promotes edit disentanglement and locality while preserving global output coherence, enabling single-pass, instance-level editing.",

Cognitive studies suggest that humans address such tasks through two mechanisms: cross-view correspondence, which identifies regions across different views that correspond to the same physical locations, and stepwise viewpoint transformation, which composes relative viewpoint changes sequentially. However, existing studies incorporate these mechanisms only partially and often implicitly, without explicit supervision for both. We propose Human-Aware Training for Cross-view correspondence and viewpoint cHange (HATCH), a training framework with two complementary objectives: (1) Patch-Level Spatial Alignment, which encourages patch representations to align across views for spatially corresponding regions, and (2) Action-then-Answer Reasoning, which requires the model to generate explicit viewpoint transition actions before predicting the final answer. Experiments on three benchmarks demonstrate that HATCH consistently outperforms baselines of comparable size by a clear margin and achieves competitive results against much larger models, while preserving single-image reasoning capabilities.",

    "abstract": "Video generation is rapidly evolving towards unified audio-video generation. In this paper, we present ALIVE, a generation model that adapts a pretrained Text-to-Video (T2V) model to Sora-style audio-video generation and animation. In particular, the model unlocks the Text-to-Video&Audio (T2VA) and Reference-to-Video&Audio (animation) capabilities compared to the T2V foundation models. To support the audio-visual synchronization and reference animation, we augment the popular MMDiT architecture with a joint audio-video branch which includes TA-CrossAttn for temporally-aligned cross-modal fusion and UniTemp-RoPE for precise audio-visual alignment. Meanwhile, a comprehensive data pipeline consisting of audio-video captioning, quality control, etc., is carefully designed to collect high-quality finetuning data. Additionally, we introduce a new benchmark to perform a comprehensive model test and comparison. After continue pretraining and finetuning on million-level high-quality data, ALIVE demonstrates outstanding performance, consistently outperforming open-source models and matching or surpassing state-of-the-art commercial solutions. With detailed recipes and benchmarks, we hope ALIVE helps the community develop audio-video generation models more efficiently. Official page: https://github.com/FoundationVision/Alive.",

These real-world constraints are rarely convex, nor the densities considered are (log-)concave. This makes computing this constrained maximum a posteriori (MAP) prediction efficiently and reliably extremely challenging. In this paper, we first investigate under which conditions we can perform constrained MAP inference over continuous variables exactly and efficiently and devise a scalable message-passing algorithm for this tractable fragment. Then, we devise a general constrained MAP strategy that interleaves partitioning the domain into convex feasible regions with numerical constrained optimization. We evaluate both methods on synthetic and real-world benchmarks, showing our approaches outperform constraint-agnostic baselines, and scale to complex densities intractable for SoTA exact solvers.",

    "abstract": "While LLaDA2.0 showcased the scaling potential of 100B-level block-diffusion models and their inherent parallelization, the delicate equilibrium between decoding speed and generation quality has remained an elusive frontier. Today, we unveil LLaDA2.1, a paradigm shift designed to transcend this trade-off. By seamlessly weaving Token-to-Token (T2T) editing into the conventional Mask-to-Token (M2T) scheme, we introduce a joint, configurable threshold-decoding scheme. This structural innovation gives rise to two distinct personas: the Speedy Mode (S Mode), which audaciously lowers the M2T threshold to bypass traditional constraints while relying on T2T to refine the output; and the Quality Mode (Q Mode), which leans into conservative thresholds to secure superior benchmark performances with manageable efficiency degrade. Furthering this evolution, underpinned by an expansive context window, we implement the first large-scale Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework specifically tailored for dLLMs, anchored by specialized techniques for stable gradient estimation. This alignment not only sharpens reasoning precision but also elevates instruction-following fidelity, bridging the chasm between diffusion dynamics and complex human intent. We culminate this work by releasing LLaDA2.1-Mini (16B) and LLaDA2.1-Flash (100B). Across 33 rigorous benchmarks, LLaDA2.1 delivers strong task performance and lightning-fast decoding speed. Despite its 100B volume, on coding tasks it attains an astounding 892 TPS on HumanEval+, 801 TPS on BigCodeBench, and 663 TPS on LiveCodeBench.",

Although improving Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning has attracted significant research efforts, the extent to which the fundamental paradigms induce generalization has yet to be systematically explored. In this study, we shed light on how the interplay between these core paradigms influences LLMs' reasoning behavior. To this end, we first collect a new dataset of reasoning trajectories from symbolic tasks, each targeting one of the three fundamental paradigms, to abstract from concrete world knowledge. Then, we investigate effective ways for inducing these skills into LLMs. We experiment with a battery of methods including simple fine-tuning, and more complex approaches to increase model depth, or transform a dense model to a mixture-of-experts. We comprehensively evaluate induced models on realistic out-of-domain tasks, that are entirely formulated in natural language and contain real-world knowledge. Our results reveal that our approach yields strong generalizability with substantial performance gains (up to $14.60$) across realistic tasks.",

    "abstract": "Multi-agent collaboration has emerged as a promising paradigm for enhancing reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, existing approaches remain largely heuristic, lacking principled guidance on what drives performance gains and how to systematically optimize multi-agent reasoning. Specifically, it remains unclear why multi-agent collaboration outperforms single-agent reasoning and which design choices contribute most to these gains, making it difficult to build better systems.   We address this gap by introducing a unified theoretical framework that decomposes multi-agent reasoning gains into three conceptually independent dimensions: Exploration for diverse solution coverage, Information for high-fidelity feedback, and Aggregation for principled consensus. Through this lens, existing methods can be understood as special cases that optimize only subsets of these dimensions. Building upon this decomposition, a novel framework called PRISM (Propose-Review-Integrate Synthesis for Multi-agent Reasoning) is proposed, which jointly maximizes all three dimensions through role-based diversity, execution-grounded feedback with evidence-based cross-evaluation, and iterative synthesis with closed-loop validation. Extensive experiments across mathematical reasoning, code generation, and function calling benchmarks demonstrate that PRISM achieves state-of-the-art performance with superior compute-efficiency compared to methods optimizing partial dimensions. The theoretical framework provides actionable design principles for future multi-agent reasoning systems.",

To address these, we propose a novel long-horizon RL framework integrating online personalization with Adaptive Tree-based Group Relative Policy Optimization (AT-GRPO). Adopting a two-agent game paradigm, a user agent constructs dynamic environments via style mimicry (learning user-specific conversational traits) and active termination (predicting turn-level termination probabilities as immediate rewards), forming an iterative cycle that drives the dialogue agent to deepen interest exploration. AT-GRPO reinterprets dialogue trajectories as trees and introduces adaptive observation ranges. Unlike full tree expansion that incurs exponential overhead, it limits each node to aggregate rewards from a stage-aware range: larger ranges support early-stage topic exploration, while smaller ranges facilitate late-stage dialogue maintenance. This design reduces rollout budgets from exponential to polynomial in the dialogue length, while preserving long-term reward capture. Extensive experiments show our framework's superior performance, sample efficiency, and robustness.",

    "abstract": "Food segmentation models trained on static images have achieved strong performance on benchmark datasets; however, their reliability in video settings remains poorly understood. In real-world applications such as food monitoring and instance counting, segmentation outputs must be temporally consistent, yet image-trained models often break down when deployed on videos. In this work, we analyze this failure through an instance segmentation and tracking perspective, focusing on apples as a representative food category. Models are trained solely on image-level food segmentation data and evaluated on video sequences using an instance segmentation with tracking-by-matching framework, enabling object-level temporal analysis. Our results reveal that high frame-wise segmentation accuracy does not translate to stable instance identities over time. Temporal appearance variations, particularly illumination changes, specular reflections, and texture ambiguity, lead to mask flickering and identity fragmentation, resulting in significant errors in apple counting. These failures are largely overlooked by conventional image-based metrics, which substantially overestimate real-world video performance. Beyond diagnosing the problem, we examine practical remedies that do not require full video supervision, including post-hoc temporal regularization and self-supervised temporal consistency objectives. Our findings suggest that the root cause of failure lies in image-centric training objectives that ignore temporal coherence, rather than model capacity. This study highlights a critical evaluation gap in food segmentation research and motivates temporally-aware learning and evaluation protocols for video-based food analysis.",

Current models often struggle with these videos because existing benchmarks focus primarily on general-purpose tasks and neglect the reasoning of commercial intent. In this work, we first propose a multi-modal information density assessment framework to quantify the complexity of this domain. Our evaluation reveals that e-commerce content exhibits substantially higher density across visual, audio, and textual modalities compared to mainstream datasets, establishing a more challenging frontier for video understanding. To address this gap, we introduce E-commerce Video Ads Benchmark (E-VAds), which is the first benchmark specifically designed for e-commerce short video understanding. We curated 3,961 high-quality videos from Taobao covering a wide range of product categories and used a multi-agent system to generate 19,785 open-ended Q&A pairs. These questions are organized into two primary dimensions, namely Perception and Cognition and Reasoning, which consist of five distinct tasks. Finally, we develop E-VAds-R1, an RL-based reasoning model featuring a multi-grained reward design called MG-GRPO. This strategy provides smooth guidance for early exploration while creating a non-linear incentive for expert-level precision. Experimental results demonstrate that E-VAds-R1 achieves a 109.2% performance gain in commercial intent reasoning with only a few hundred training samples.",

Meanwhile, the rapid proliferation of Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents has intensified demand for highly personalized services that require the dynamic provision of diverse personal data. This presents a significant challenge: balancing the utilization of such data with privacy protection. To address this challenge, we propose Puda (Private User Dataset Agent), a user-sovereign architecture that aggregates data across services and enables client-side management. Puda allows users to control data sharing at three privacy levels: (i) Detailed Browsing History, (ii) Extracted Keywords, and (iii) Predefined Category Subsets. We implemented Puda as a browser-based system that serves as a common platform across diverse services and evaluated it through a personalized travel planning task. Our results show that providing Predefined Category Subsets achieves 97.2% of the personalization performance (evaluated via an LLM-as-a-Judge framework across three criteria) obtained when sharing Detailed Browsing History. These findings demonstrate that Puda enables effective multi-granularity management, offering practical choices to mitigate the privacy-personalization trade-off. Overall, Puda provides an AI-native foundation for user sovereignty, empowering users to safely leverage the full potential of personalized AI.",

In this paper, we observe that SAM2 exhibits sparse perception pattern as biological vision, which provides opportunities for eliminating redundant computation and acceleration: i) In mask decoder, the attention primarily focuses on the foreground objects, whereas the image encoder in the earlier stage exhibits a broad attention span, which results in unnecessary computation to background regions. ii) In memory bank, only a small subset of tokens in each frame contribute significantly to memory attention, and the salient regions exhibit temporal consistency, making full-token computation redundant. With these insights, we propose Efficient-SAM2, which promotes SAM2 to adaptively focus on object regions while eliminating task-irrelevant computations, thereby significantly improving inference efficiency. Specifically, for image encoder, we propose object-aware Sparse Window Routing (SWR), a window-level computation allocation mechanism that leverages the consistency and saliency cues from the previous-frame decoder to route background regions into a lightweight shortcut branch. Moreover, for memory attention, we propose object-aware Sparse Memory Retrieval (SMR), which allows only the salient memory tokens in each frame to participate in computation, with the saliency pattern reused from their first recollection. With negligible additional parameters and minimal training overhead, Efficient-SAM2 delivers 1.68x speedup on SAM2.1-L model with only 1.0% accuracy drop on SA-V test set.",

    "abstract": "LLM deployment on resource-constrained edge devices faces severe latency constraints, particularly in real-time applications where delayed responses can compromise safety or usability. Among many approaches to mitigate the inefficiencies of sequential token-by-token generation, Speculative Decoding (SD) has emerged as a promising technique. However, SD at the edge is hindered by two major challenges: (1) integrating SD into a compiler-based workflow without sacrificing performance or programmability, and (2) exploiting the heterogeneous compute resources of modern SoCs through carefully designed partitioning strategies. This work addresses these challenges by using an analytical cost model that explores heterogeneous hardware configurations and guides coarse-grained partitioning of LLM subgraphs, particularly with edge-typical short input sequence lengths. The cost model predicts when speculative sampling and heterogeneous execution are jointly beneficial and is validated on an edge device featuring a hexacore Cortex-A CPU and a Mali GPU, revealing up to 1.68$\\times$ speedup for translation tasks, closely matching analytic expectations.",

    "abstract": "Reasoning models enhance problem-solving by scaling test-time compute, yet they face a critical paradox: excessive thinking tokens often degrade performance rather than improve it. We attribute this to a fundamental architectural flaw: standard LLMs operate as \"malloc-only\" engines, continuously accumulating valid and redundant steps alike without a mechanism to prune obsolete information. To break this cycle, we propose Free()LM, a model that introduces an intrinsic self-forgetting capability via the Free-Module, a plug-and-play LoRA adapter. By iteratively switching between reasoning and cleaning modes, Free()LM dynamically identifies and prunes useless context chunks, maintaining a compact and noise-free state.   Extensive experiments show that Free()LM provides consistent improvements across all model scales (8B to 685B). It achieves a 3.3% average improvement over top-tier reasoning baselines, even establishing a new SOTA on IMOanswerBench using DeepSeek V3.2-Speciale. Most notably, in long-horizon tasks where the standard Qwen3-235B-A22B model suffers a total collapse (0% accuracy), Free()LM restores performance to 50%. Our findings suggest that sustainable intelligence requires the freedom to forget as much as the power to think.",

    "abstract": "Retrieving wrist radiographs with analogous fracture patterns is challenging because clinically important cues are subtle, highly localized and often obscured by overlapping anatomy or variable imaging views. Progress is further limited by the scarcity of large, well-annotated datasets for case-based medical image retrieval. We introduce WristMIR, a region-aware pediatric wrist radiograph retrieval framework that leverages dense radiology reports and bone-specific localization to learn fine-grained, clinically meaningful image representations without any manual image-level annotations. Using MedGemma-based structured report mining to generate both global and region-level captions, together with pre-processed wrist images and bone-specific crops of the distal radius, distal ulna, and ulnar styloid, WristMIR jointly trains global and local contrastive encoders and performs a two-stage retrieval process: (1) coarse global matching to identify candidate exams, followed by (2) region-conditioned reranking aligned to a predefined anatomical bone region. WristMIR improves retrieval performance over strong vision-language baselines, raising image-to-text Recall@5 from 0.82% to 9.35%. Its embeddings also yield stronger fracture classification (AUROC 0.949, AUPRC 0.953). In region-aware evaluation, the two-stage design markedly improves retrieval-based fracture diagnosis, increasing mean $F_1$ from 0.568 to 0.753, and radiologists rate its retrieved cases as more clinically relevant, with mean scores rising from 3.36 to 4.35. These findings highlight the potential of anatomically guided retrieval to enhance diagnostic reasoning and support clinical decision-making in pediatric musculoskeletal imaging.

While recent work has identified structured, human-like conceptual representations within these models, it remains unclear whether they functionally rely on such representations for reasoning. Here we investigate the internal processing of LLMs during in-context concept inference. Our results reveal a conceptual subspace emerging in middle to late layers, whose representational structure persists across contexts. Using causal mediation analyses, we demonstrate that this subspace is not merely an epiphenomenon but is functionally central to model predictions, establishing its causal role in inference. We further identify a layer-wise progression where attention heads in early-to-middle layers integrate contextual cues to construct and refine the subspace, which is subsequently leveraged by later layers to generate predictions. Together, these findings provide evidence that LLMs dynamically construct and use structured, latent representations in context for inference, offering insights into the computational processes underlying flexible adaptation.",

    "abstract": "Any entity in the visual world can be hierarchically grouped based on shared characteristics and mapped to fine-grained sub-categories. While Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) achieve strong performance on coarse-grained visual tasks, they often struggle with Fine-Grained Visual Recognition (FGVR). Adapting general-purpose MLLMs to FGVR typically requires large amounts of annotated data, which is costly to obtain, leaving a substantial performance gap compared to contrastive CLIP models dedicated for discriminative tasks. Moreover, MLLMs tend to overfit to seen sub-categories and generalize poorly to unseen ones. To address these challenges, we propose Fine-R1, an MLLM tailored for FGVR through an R1-style training framework: (1) Chain-of-Thought Supervised Fine-tuning, where we construct a high-quality FGVR CoT dataset with rationales of \"visual analysis, candidate sub-categories, comparison, and prediction\", transition the model into a strong open-world classifier; and (2) Triplet Augmented Policy Optimization, where Intra-class Augmentation mixes trajectories from anchor and positive images within the same category to improve robustness to intra-class variance, while Inter-class Augmentation maximizes the response distinction conditioned on images across sub-categories to enhance discriminative ability. With only 4-shot training, Fine-R1 outperforms existing general MLLMs, reasoning MLLMs, and even contrastive CLIP models in identifying both seen and unseen sub-categories, showing promise in working in knowledge-intensive domains where gathering expert annotations for all sub-categories is arduous.

Although several AI-based approaches have been proposed to address isolated subtasks of MSP, a unified methodology for solving the entire MSP task has yet to be established. We propose MSP-LLM, a unified LLM-based framework that formulates MSP as a structured process composed of two constituent subproblems: precursor prediction (PP) and synthesis operation prediction (SOP). Our approach introduces a discrete material class as an intermediate decision variable that organizes both tasks into a chemically consistent decision chain. For OP, we further incorporate hierarchical precursor types as synthesis-relevant inductive biases and employ an explicit conditioning strategy that preserves precursor-related information in the autoregressive decoding state. Extensive experiments show that MSP-LLM consistently outperforms existing methods on both PP and SOP, as well as on the complete MSP task, demonstrating an effective and scalable framework for MSP that can accelerate real-world materials discovery.",

    "abstract": "Simulations are an indispensable step in the cycle of theory development and refinement, helping researchers formulate precise definitions, generate models, and make accurate predictions. This paper introduces the Pavlovian Associative Learning Models Simulator (PALMS), a Python environment to simulate Pavlovian conditioning experiments. In addition to the canonical Rescorla-Wagner model, PALMS incorporates several attentional learning approaches, including Pearce-Kaye-Hall, Mackintosh Extended, Le Pelley's Hybrid, and a novel extension of the Rescorla-Wagner model with a unified variable learning rate that integrates Mackintosh's and Pearce and Hall's opposing conceptualisations. The simulator's graphical interface allows for the input of entire experimental designs in an alphanumeric format, akin to that used by experimental neuroscientists. Moreover, it uniquely enables the simulation of experiments involving hundreds of stimuli, as well as the computation of configural cues and configural-cue compounds across all models, thereby considerably expanding their predictive capabilities. PALMS operates efficiently, providing instant visualisation of results, supporting rapid, precise comparisons of various models' predictions within a single architecture and environment. Furthermore, graphic displays can be easily saved, and simulated data can be exported to spreadsheets. To illustrate the simulator's capabilities and functionalities, we provide a detailed description of the software and examples of use, reproducing published experiments in the associative learning literature.

To address the instability of audio features in streaming scenarios, we introduce Streaming-Aware Spatiotemporal Pre-training equipped with a Temporal Audio Context Cache mechanism, which ensures robust feature extraction from short audio fragments. Furthermore, to mitigate the error accumulation and identity drift inherent in long-sequence autoregressive generation, we propose Oracle-Guided Bidirectional Distillation, leveraging ground-truth motion priors to provide precise physical guidance. We also present VividHead, a large-scale, high-quality dataset containing 782 hours of strictly aligned footage to support robust training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SoulX-FlashHead achieves state-of-the-art performance on HDTF and VFHQ benchmarks.

Tabular data in finance and healthcare is highly sensitive, yet existing UE methods transfer poorly because tabular features mix numerical and categorical constraints and exhibit saliency sparsity, with learning dominated by a few dimensions. Under a Spectral Dominance condition, we show certified unlearnability is feasible when the poison spectrum overwhelms the clean semantic spectrum. Guided by this, we propose Unlearnable Tabular Data via DecOuPled Shortcut EmbeddIng (UTOPIA), which exploits feature redundancy to decouple optimization into two channels: high saliency features for semantic obfuscation and low saliency redundant features for embedding a hyper correlated shortcut, yielding constraint-aware dominant shortcuts while preserving tabular validity. Extensive experiments across tabular datasets and models show UTOPIA drives unauthorized training toward near random performance, outperforming strong UE baselines and transferring well across architectures.",

However, contemporary research typically aggregates patient data into fixed time intervals, simplifying their mapping to standard ORL frameworks. The impact of these temporal manipulations on model safety and efficacy remains poorly understood. In this work, using both a gridworld navigation task and the UVA/Padova clinical diabetes simulator, we demonstrate that temporal resampling significantly degrades the performance of offline reinforcement learning algorithms during live deployment. We propose three mechanisms that drive this failure: (i) the generation of counterfactual trajectories, (ii) the distortion of temporal expectations, and (iii) the compounding of generalisation errors. Crucially, we find that standard off-policy evaluation metrics can fail to detect these drops in performance. Our findings reveal a fundamental risk in current healthcare ORL pipelines and emphasise the need for methods that explicitly handle the irregular timing of clinical decision-making.",

    "abstract": "Despite recent successes, test-time scaling - i.e., dynamically expanding the token budget during inference as needed - remains brittle for vision-language models (VLMs): unstructured chains-of-thought about images entangle perception and reasoning, leading to long, disorganized contexts where small perceptual mistakes may cascade into completely wrong answers. Moreover, expensive reinforcement learning with hand-crafted rewards is required to achieve good performance. Here, we introduce SPARC (Separating Perception And Reasoning Circuits), a modular framework that explicitly decouples visual perception from reasoning. Inspired by sequential sensory-to-cognitive processing in the brain, SPARC implements a two-stage pipeline where the model first performs explicit visual search to localize question-relevant regions, then conditions its reasoning on those regions to produce the final answer. This separation enables independent test-time scaling with asymmetric compute allocation (e.g., prioritizing perceptual processing under distribution shift), supports selective optimization (e.g., improving the perceptual stage alone when it is the bottleneck for end-to-end performance), and accommodates compressed contexts by running global search at lower image resolutions and allocating high-resolution processing only to selected regions, thereby reducing total visual tokens count and compute. Across challenging visual reasoning benchmarks, SPARC outperforms monolithic baselines and strong visual-grounding approaches. For instance, SPARC improves the accuracy of Qwen3VL-4B on the $V^*$ VQA benchmark by 6.7 percentage points, and it surpasses \"thinking with images\" by 4.6 points on a challenging OOD task despite requiring a 200$\\times$ lower token budget.",

    "abstract": "Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) promises grounded question answering, yet domain settings with multiple heterogeneous knowledge bases (KBs) remain challenging. In Chinese Tibetan medicine, encyclopedia entries are often dense and easy to match, which can dominate retrieval even when classics or clinical papers provide more authoritative evidence. We study a practical setting with three KBs (encyclopedia, classics, and clinical papers) and a 500-query benchmark (cutoff $K{=}5$) covering both single-KB and cross-KB questions. We propose two complementary methods to improve traceability, reduce hallucinations, and enable cross-KB verification. First, DAKS performs KB routing and budgeted retrieval to mitigate density-driven bias and to prioritize authoritative sources when appropriate. Second, we use an alignment graph to guide evidence fusion and coverage-aware packing, improving cross-KB evidence coverage without relying on naive concatenation. All answers are generated by a lightweight generator, \\textsc{openPangu-Embedded-7B}. Experiments show consistent gains in routing quality and cross-KB evidence coverage, with the full system achieving the best CrossEv@5 while maintaining strong faithfulness and citation correctness.",

However, existing approaches often treat characters as flat radical sequences, neglecting the hierarchical topology and the uneven information density of different components. To address these limitations, we propose an Entropy-Aware Structural Alignment Network that bridges the visual-semantic gap through information-theoretic modeling. First, we introduce an Information Entropy Prior to dynamically modulate positional embeddings via multiplicative interaction, acting as a saliency detector that prioritizes discriminative roots over ubiquitous components. Second, we construct a Dual-View Radical Tree to extract multi-granularity structural features, which are integrated via an adaptive Sigmoid-based gating network to encode both global layout and local spatial roles. Finally, a Top-K Semantic Feature Fusion mechanism is devised to augment the decoding process by utilizing the centroid of semantic neighbors, effectively rectifying visual ambiguities through feature-level consensus. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method establishes new state-of-the-art performance, achieving an accuracy of 55.04\\% on the ICDAR 2013 dataset ($m=1500$), significantly outperforming existing CLIP-based baselines in the challenging zero-shot setting. Furthermore, the framework exhibits exceptional data efficiency, demonstrating rapid adaptability with minimal support samples, achieving 92.41\\% accuracy with only one support sample per class.",

Many applications demand not just point estimates but interpretable uncertainty. Providing fast inference alongside uncertainty estimates remains challenging yet desirable in numerous applications.   We propose the Variational Sparse Paired Autoencoder (vsPAIR) to address this challenge. The architecture pairs a standard VAE encoding observations with a sparse VAE encoding quantities of interest, connected through a learned latent mapping. The variational structure enables uncertainty estimation, the paired architecture encourages interpretability by anchoring QoI representations to clean data, and sparse encodings provide structure by concentrating information into identifiable factors rather than diffusing across all dimensions. To validate the effectiveness of our proposed architecture, we conduct experiments on blind inpainting and computed tomography, demonstrating that vsPAIR is a capable inverse problem solver that can provide interpretable and structured uncertainty estimates.",

    "abstract": "Adaptive multimodal reasoning has emerged as a promising frontier in Vision-Language Models (VLMs), aiming to dynamically modulate between tool-augmented visual reasoning and text reasoning to enhance both effectiveness and efficiency. However, existing evaluations rely on static difficulty labels and simplistic metrics, which fail to capture the dynamic nature of difficulty relative to varying model capacities. Consequently, they obscure the distinction between adaptive mode selection and general performance while neglecting fine-grained process analyses. In this paper, we propose AdaptMMBench, a comprehensive benchmark for adaptive multimodal reasoning across five domains: real-world, OCR, GUI, knowledge, and math, encompassing both direct perception and complex reasoning tasks. AdaptMMBench utilizes a Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) metric to evaluate the selection rationality of different reasoning modes, isolating this meta-cognition ability by dynamically identifying task difficulties based on models' capability boundaries. Moreover, AdaptMMBench facilitates multi-dimensional process evaluation across key step coverage, tool effectiveness, and computational efficiency. Our evaluation reveals that while adaptive mode selection scales with model capacity, it notably decouples from final accuracy. Conversely, key step coverage aligns with performance, though tool effectiveness remains highly inconsistent across model architectures.",

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in multimodal reward models (RMs) have significantly propelled the development of visual generation. Existing frameworks typically adopt Bradley-Terry-style preference modeling or leverage generative VLMs as judges, and subsequently optimize visual generation models via reinforcement learning. However, current RMs suffer from inherent limitations: they often follow a one-size-fits-all paradigm that assumes a monolithic preference distribution or relies on fixed evaluation rubrics. As a result, they are insensitive to content-specific visual cues, leading to systematic misalignment with subjective and context-dependent human preferences. To this end, inspired by human assessment, we propose UnifiedReward-Flex, a unified personalized reward model for vision generation that couples reward modeling with flexible and context-adaptive reasoning. Specifically, given a prompt and the generated visual content, it first interprets the semantic intent and grounds on visual evidence, then dynamically constructs a hierarchical assessment by instantiating fine-grained criteria under both predefined and self-generated high-level dimensions. Our training pipeline follows a two-stage process: (1) we first distill structured, high-quality reasoning traces from advanced closed-source VLMs to bootstrap SFT, equipping the model with flexible and context-adaptive reasoning behaviors; (2) we then perform direct preference optimization (DPO) on carefully curated preference pairs to further strengthen reasoning fidelity and discriminative alignment. To validate the effectiveness, we integrate UnifiedReward-Flex into the GRPO framework for image and video synthesis, and extensive results demonstrate its superiority.",

Accurately aligning molecular structure with natural language is therefore essential for enabling large language models (LLMs) to reason about downstream chemical tasks. However, the substantial cost of human annotation makes it infeasible to construct large-scale, high-quality datasets of structure-grounded descriptions. In this work, we propose a fully automated annotation framework for generating precise molecular structure descriptions at scale. Our approach builds upon and extends a rule-based chemical nomenclature parser to interpret IUPAC names and construct enriched, structured XML metadata that explicitly encodes molecular structure. This metadata is then used to guide LLMs in producing accurate natural-language descriptions. Using this framework, we curate a large-scale dataset of approximately $163$k molecule-description pairs. A rigorous validation protocol combining LLM-based and expert human evaluation on a subset of $2,000$ molecules demonstrates a high description precision of $98.6\\%$. The resulting dataset provides a reliable foundation for future molecule-language alignment, and the proposed annotation method is readily extensible to larger datasets and broader chemical tasks that rely on structural descriptions.",

    "abstract": "Modern scientific research relies on large-scale data, complex workflows, and specialized tools, which existing LLMs and tool-based agents struggle to handle due to limitations in long-horizon planning, robust goal maintenance, and continual learning from execution. To address these issues, in this work, we propose S1-NexusAgent, a self-evolving agent framework designed for multidisciplinary scientific research. S1-NexusAgent adopts a hierarchical Plan-and-CodeAct execution paradigm, decoupling global scientific planning from subtask-level tool execution through a dual-loop architecture, thereby enabling stable modeling of complex research workflows. The system natively supports the Model Context Protocol (MCP), integrates up to thousands of cross-disciplinary scientific tools, and achieves efficient orchestration of heterogeneous research tools via intention-aware dynamic tool retrieval and hot-plug mechanisms. To address long-context and large-scale data challenges in scientific settings, S1-NexusAgent introduces object-reference-based sparse context management, which enables sub-task context isolation and intermediate result compression. Building on this, a Critic Agent automatically evaluates complete execution trajectories and distills high-quality research paths into reusable Scientific Skills, forming a closed loop for continuous self-evolution, which is valuable for sustainable and long-horizon scientific research. Experiments on authoritative scientific benchmarks involving long-horizon planning and complex specialized tool orchestration, including biomini-eval (biology), ChemBench (chemistry), and MatSciBench (material science), demonstrate that S1-NexusAgent achieves state-of-the-art performance, validating its effectiveness and generalization capability in complex scientific tasks.",

    "abstract": "Recently, Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have emerged in Real-World Image Super-Resolution (Real-ISR) to generate high-quality textures, yet their heavy inference burden hinders real-world deployment. While Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) is a promising solution for acceleration, existing methods in super-resolution mostly focus on U-Net architectures, whereas generic DiT quantization is typically designed for text-to-image tasks. Directly applying these methods to DiT-based super-resolution models leads to severe degradation of local textures. Therefore, we propose Q-DiT4SR, the first PTQ framework specifically tailored for DiT-based Real-ISR. We propose H-SVD, a hierarchical SVD that integrates a global low-rank branch with a local block-wise rank-1 branch under a matched parameter budget. We further propose Variance-aware Spatio-Temporal Mixed Precision: VaSMP allocates cross-layer weight bit-widths in a data-free manner based on rate-distortion theory, while VaTMP schedules intra-layer activation precision across diffusion timesteps via dynamic programming (DP) with minimal calibration. Experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that our Q-DiT4SR achieves SOTA performance under both W4A6 and W4A4 settings. Notably, the W4A4 quantization configuration reduces model size by 5.8$\\times$ and computational operations by over 60$\\times$.

Hallucinations denote generated content that is grammatically and syntactically coherent, yet bears no match or direct relevance to actual visual input. To address this problem, we propose Residual Decoding (ResDec). It is a novel training-free method that uses historical information to aid decoding. The method relies on the internal implicit reasoning mechanism and token logits evolution mechanism of LVLMs to correct biases. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ResDec effectively suppresses hallucinations induced by language priors, significantly improves visual grounding, and reduces object hallucinations. In addition to mitigating hallucinations, ResDec also performs exceptionally well on comprehensive LVLM benchmarks, highlighting its broad applicability.",

    "abstract": "Model editing has emerged as a practical approach for mitigating factual errors and outdated knowledge in large language models (LLMs). Among existing methods, the Locate-and-Edit (L&E) paradigm is the dominant framework: it locates MLP parameters implicated in expressing a target fact, and then performs a localized update to rewrite that fact. However, long sequences of edits often trigger abrupt model collapse in L&E beyond a critical point. We empirically identify a strong correlation between collapse and explosive growth of edited MLP weight norms, and formally prove that commonly used L&E update rules can induce exponential norm growth across sequential edits in the absence of explicit norm control. To address this issue, we propose Norm-Anchor Scaling NAS, a plug-and-play norm-constrained strategy. Across extensive experiments, NAS delays the collapse point of representative L&E algorithms by more than 4 times and yields a 72.2% average relative gain in editing performance, requiring only a single additional line of code and incurring negligible computational overhead.",

    "abstract": "The research of artificial intelligence is undergoing a paradigm shift from prioritizing model innovations over benchmark scores towards emphasizing problem definition and rigorous real-world evaluation. As the field enters the \"second half,\" the central challenge becomes real utility in long-horizon, dynamic, and user-dependent environments, where agents face context explosion and must continuously accumulate, manage, and selectively reuse large volumes of information across extended interactions. Memory, with hundreds of papers released this year, therefore emerges as the critical solution to fill the utility gap. In this survey, we provide a unified view of foundation agent memory along three dimensions: memory substrate (internal and external), cognitive mechanism (episodic, semantic, sensory, working, and procedural), and memory subject (agent- and user-centric). We then analyze how memory is instantiated and operated under different agent topologies and highlight learning policies over memory operations. Finally, we review evaluation benchmarks and metrics for assessing memory utility, and outline various open challenges and future directions.",

    "abstract": "Language models now provide an interface to express and often solve general problems in natural language, yet their ultimate computational capabilities remain a major topic of scientific debate. Unlike a formal computer, a language model is trained to autoregressively predict successive elements in human-generated text. We prove that chaining a language model's autoregressive output is sufficient to perform universal computation. That is, a language model can simulate the execution of any algorithm on any input. The challenge of eliciting desired computational behaviour can thus be reframed in terms of programmability: the ease of finding a suitable prompt. Strikingly, we demonstrate that even randomly initialized language models are capable of universal computation before training. This implies that training does not give rise to computational expressiveness -- rather, it improves programmability, enabling a natural language interface for accessing these intrinsic capabilities.",

In this paper, we study the fundamental question that prior work has overlooked: \"When during pretraining should safety interventions be introduced?\" We keep the underlying data sources and pretraining interventions fixed, varying the intervention start time (after 0%, 20%, or 60% of pretraining tokens). We find that the optimal start time is not one-size-fits-all: with standard top-k decoding, introducing interventions after a short initial phase of safe-only pretraining (20%-60%) often yields the strongest robustness, with the clearest benefits emerging after downstream, benign finetuning. In contrast, for safety-aware inference, interventions starting from the beginning improve steerability towards safer generations. Finally, we observe that earlier interventions reshape internal representations: linear probes more cleanly separate safe vs harmful examples. Our results are the first to establish intervention timing as a key curriculum design choice for safety.",

For autonomous agents, these passive and flat architectures lack the cognitive organization necessary to model the dynamic and associative nature of long-term interaction. To address this, we propose Structured Episodic Event Memory (SEEM), a hierarchical framework that synergizes a graph memory layer for relational facts with a dynamic episodic memory layer for narrative progression. Grounded in cognitive frame theory, SEEM transforms interaction streams into structured Episodic Event Frames (EEFs) anchored by precise provenance pointers. Furthermore, we introduce an agentic associative fusion and Reverse Provenance Expansion (RPE) mechanism to reconstruct coherent narrative contexts from fragmented evidence. Experimental results on the LoCoMo and LongMemEval benchmarks demonstrate that SEEM significantly outperforms baselines, enabling agents to maintain superior narrative coherence and logical consistency.",

    "abstract": "Vision-language models are increasingly deployed as computer-use agents (CUAs) that operate desktops and browsers. Top-performing CUAs are framework-based systems that decompose planning and execution, while end-to-end screenshot-to-action policies are easier to deploy but lag behind on benchmarks such as OSWorld-Verified. GUI datasets like OSWorld pose two bottlenecks: they expose only a few hundred interactive, verifiable tasks and environments, and expert trajectories must be gathered by interacting with these environments, making such data hard to scale. We therefore ask how reinforcement learning from verifiable rewards (RLVR) can best exploit a small pool of exist expert trajectories to train end-to-end policies. Naively mixing these off-policy traces into on-policy RLVR is brittle: even after format conversion, expert trajectories exhibit structural mismatch and distribution shift from the learner. We propose BEPA (Bi-Level Expert-to-Policy Assimilation), which turns static expert traces into policy-aligned guidance via self-rolled reachable trajectories under the base policy (LEVEL-1) and a per-task, dynamically updated cache used in RLVR (LEVEL-2). On OSWorld-Verified, BEPA improves UITARS1.5-7B success from 22.87% to 32.13% and raises a held-out split from 5.74% to 10.30%, with consistent gains on MMBench-GUI and Online-Mind2Web.

We present an experimental, system-oriented analysis of long-term dialog memory architectures. We introduce a unified framework that decomposes dialog memory systems into core components and supports both graph-based and non-graph approaches. Under this framework, we conduct controlled, stage-wise experiments on LongMemEval and HaluMem, comparing common design choices in memory representation, organization, maintenance, and retrieval. Our results show that many performance differences are driven by foundational system settings rather than specific architectural innovations.

    "abstract": "Quality diversity (QD) optimization searches for a collection of solutions that optimize an objective while attaining diverse outputs of a user-specified, vector-valued measure function. Contemporary QD algorithms are typically limited to low-dimensional measures because high-dimensional measures are prone to distortion, where many solutions found by the QD algorithm map to similar measures. For example, the state-of-the-art CMA-MAE algorithm guides measure space exploration with a histogram in measure space that records so-called discount values. However, CMA-MAE stagnates in domains with high-dimensional measure spaces because solutions with similar measures fall into the same histogram cell and hence receive the same discount value. To address these limitations, we propose Discount Model Search (DMS), which guides exploration with a model that provides a smooth, continuous representation of discount values. In high-dimensional measure spaces, this model enables DMS to distinguish between solutions with similar measures and thus continue exploration. We show that DMS facilitates new capabilities for QD algorithms by introducing two new domains where the measure space is the high-dimensional space of images, which enables users to specify their desired measures by providing a dataset of images rather than hand-designing the measure function. Results in these domains and on high-dimensional benchmarks show that DMS outperforms CMA-MAE and other existing black-box QD algorithms.",

    "abstract": "Online eXp-concave Optimization (OXO) is a fundamental problem in online learning, where the goal is to minimize regret when loss functions are exponentially concave. The standard algorithm, Online Newton Step (ONS), guarantees an optimal $O(d \\log T)$ regret, where $d$ is the dimension and $T$ is the time horizon. Despite its simplicity, ONS may face a computational bottleneck due to the Mahalanobis projection at each round. This step costs $Ω(d^ω)$ arithmetic operations for bounded domains, even for simple domains such as the unit ball, where $ω\\in (2,3]$ is the matrix-multiplication exponent. As a result, the total runtime can reach $\\tilde{O}(d^ωT)$, particularly when iterates frequently oscillate near the domain boundary. This paper proposes a simple variant of ONS, called LightONS, which reduces the total runtime to $O(d^2 T + d^ω\\sqrt{T \\log T})$ while preserving the optimal regret. Deploying LightONS with the online-to-batch conversion implies a method for stochastic exp-concave optimization with runtime $\\tilde{O}(d^3/ε)$, thereby answering an open problem posed by Koren [2013]. The design leverages domain-conversion techniques from parameter-free online learning and defers expensive Mahalanobis projections until necessary, thereby preserving the elegant structure of ONS and enabling LightONS to act as an efficient plug-in replacement in broader scenarios, including gradient-norm adaptivity, parametric stochastic bandits, and memory-efficient OXO.",

    "abstract": "As Vision Transformers (ViTs) become standard vision backbones, a mechanistic account of their computational phenomenology is essential. Despite architectural cues that hint at dynamical structure, there is no settled framework that interprets Transformer depth as a well-characterized flow. In this work, we introduce the Block-Recurrent Hypothesis (BRH), arguing that trained ViTs admit a block-recurrent depth structure such that the computation of the original $L$ blocks can be accurately rewritten using only $k \\ll L$ distinct blocks applied recurrently. Across diverse ViTs, between-layer representational similarity matrices suggest few contiguous phases. To determine whether these phases reflect genuinely reusable computation, we train block-recurrent surrogates of pretrained ViTs: Recurrent Approximations to Phase-structured TransfORmers (Raptor). In small-scale, we demonstrate that stochastic depth and training promote recurrent structure and subsequently correlate with our ability to accurately fit Raptor. We then provide an empirical existence proof for BRH by training a Raptor model to recover $96\\%$ of DINOv2 ImageNet-1k linear probe accuracy in only 2 blocks at equivalent runtime. Finally, we leverage our hypothesis to develop a program of Dynamical Interpretability. We find i) directional convergence into class-dependent angular basins with self-correcting trajectories under small perturbations, ii) token-specific dynamics, where cls executes sharp late reorientations while patch tokens exhibit strong late-stage coherence toward their mean direction, and iii) a collapse to low rank updates in late depth, consistent with convergence to low-dimensional attractors. Altogether, we find a compact recurrent program emerges along ViT depth, pointing to a low-complexity normative solution that enables these models to be studied through principled dynamical systems analysis.",

    "abstract": "Indonesian, spoken by over 200 million people, remains underserved in multimodal emotion recognition research despite its dominant presence on Southeast Asian social media platforms. We introduce IndoMER, the first multimodal emotion recognition benchmark for Indonesian, comprising 1,944 video segments from 203 speakers with temporally aligned text, audio, and visual annotations across seven emotion categories. The dataset exhibits realistic challenges including cross-modal inconsistency and long-tailed class distributions shaped by Indonesian cultural communication norms. To address these challenges, we propose OmniMER, a multimodal adaptation framework built upon Qwen2.5-Omni that enhances emotion recognition through three auxiliary modality-specific perception tasks: emotion keyword extraction for text, facial expression analysis for video, and prosody analysis for audio. These auxiliary tasks help the model identify emotion-relevant cues in each modality before fusion, reducing reliance on spurious correlations in low-resource settings. Experiments on IndoMER show that OmniMER achieves 0.582 Macro-F1 on sentiment classification and 0.454 on emotion recognition, outperforming the base model by 7.6 and 22.1 absolute points respectively. Cross-lingual evaluation on the Chinese CH-SIMS dataset further demonstrates the generalizability of the proposed framework.

Instead of relying solely on data-driven optimization, our proposed approach incorporates the Linear Spectral Mixing Model (LSMM) as a physical constraint and physically-based Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM), ensuring that learned representations adhere to known structural relationships between observed signals and their latent components. The framework jointly optimizes LSMM and SAM loss with a conventional Huber loss objective, promoting both numerical accuracy and geometric consistency in the feature space. This knowledge-guided design enhances reconstruction fidelity, stabilizes training under limited supervision, and yields interpretable latent representations grounded in physical principles. The experimental findings indicate that the proposed model substantially enhances reconstruction quality and improves downstream task performance, highlighting the promise of embedding physics-informed inductive biases within transformer-based self-supervised learning.",

    "abstract": "Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) are central to modeling complex systems across physical, biological, and engineering domains, yet traditional numerical methods often struggle with high-dimensional or complex problems. Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged as an efficient alternative by embedding physics-based constraints into deep learning frameworks, but they face challenges in achieving high accuracy and handling complex boundary conditions. In this work, we extend the Time-Evolving Natural Gradient (TENG) framework to address Dirichlet boundary conditions, integrating natural gradient optimization with numerical time-stepping schemes, including Euler and Heun methods, to ensure both stability and accuracy. By incorporating boundary condition penalty terms into the loss function, the proposed approach enables precise enforcement of Dirichlet constraints. Experiments on the heat equation demonstrate the superior accuracy of the Heun method due to its second-order corrections and the computational efficiency of the Euler method for simpler scenarios. This work establishes a foundation for extending the framework to Neumann and mixed boundary conditions, as well as broader classes of PDEs, advancing the applicability of neural network-based solvers for real-world problems.",

With the rising focus on spatial AI in recent years, combining SLAM with semantic understanding has become increasingly important for enabling intelligent perception and interaction. Recent efforts have explored this integration, but they often rely on depth sensors or closed-set semantic models, limiting their scalability and adaptability in open-world environments. In this work, we present OpenMonoGS-SLAM, the first monocular SLAM framework that unifies 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) with open-set semantic understanding. To achieve our goal, we leverage recent advances in Visual Foundation Models (VFMs), including MASt3R for visual geometry and SAM and CLIP for open-vocabulary semantics. These models provide robust generalization across diverse tasks, enabling accurate monocular camera tracking and mapping, as well as a rich understanding of semantics in open-world environments. Our method operates without any depth input or 3D semantic ground truth, relying solely on self-supervised learning objectives. Furthermore, we propose a memory mechanism specifically designed to manage high-dimensional semantic features, which effectively constructs Gaussian semantic feature maps, leading to strong overall performance. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves performance comparable to or surpassing existing baselines in both closed-set and open-set segmentation tasks, all without relying on supplementary sensors such as depth maps or semantic annotations.",

    "abstract": "Diffusion models are usually evaluated by their final outputs, gradually denoising random noise into meaningful images. Yet, generation unfolds along a trajectory, and analyzing this dynamic process is crucial for understanding how controllable, reliable, and predictable these models are in terms of their success/failure modes. In this work, we ask the question: when does noise turn into a specific concept (e.g., age) and lock in the denoising trajectory? We propose PCI (Prompt-Conditioned Intervention) to study this question. PCI is a training-free and model-agnostic framework for analyzing concept dynamics through diffusion time. The central idea is the analysis of Concept Insertion Success (CIS), defined as the probability that a concept inserted at a given timestep is preserved and reflected in the final image, offering a way to characterize the temporal dynamics of concept formation. Applied to several state-of-the-art text-to-image diffusion models and a broad taxonomy of concepts, PCI reveals diverse temporal behaviors across diffusion models, in which certain phases of the trajectory are more favorable to specific concepts even within the same concept type. These findings also provide actionable insights for text-driven image editing, highlighting when interventions are most effective without requiring access to model internals or training, and yielding quantitatively stronger edits that achieve a balance of semantic accuracy and content preservation than strong baselines.

Using large language models as statistical oracles, we measure the minimum context length (MCL) needed to reproduce accurate full-context predictions across datasets with sequences of varying lengths. For sequences with 1-7k tokens from long-context documents, we consistently find that 75-80% require only the last 96 tokens at most. Given the dominance of short-context tokens, we then ask whether it is possible to detect challenging long-context sequences for which a short local prefix does not suffice for prediction. We introduce a practical proxy to MCL, called Distributionally Aware MCL (DaMCL), that does not require knowledge of the actual next-token and is compatible with sampling strategies beyond greedy decoding. Our experiments validate that simple thresholding of the metric defining DaMCL achieves high performance in detecting long vs. short context sequences. Finally, to counter the bias that short-context dominance induces in LLM output distributions, we develop an intuitive decoding algorithm that leverages our detector to identify and boost tokens that are long-range-relevant. Across Q&A tasks and model architectures, we confirm that mitigating the bias improves performance.",

This work proposes a multimodal graph neural network framework that integrates structural MRI, diffusion tensor imaging, and functional MRI to model spatiotemporal brain network reorganization. Brain regions are represented as nodes and structural and functional connectivity as edges, forming longitudinal brain graphs for each subject. Temporal evolution is captured via fractional stochastic differential operators embedded within graph-based recurrent networks, enabling the modeling of long-term dependencies and stochastic fluctuations in network dynamics. Attention mechanisms fuse multimodal information and generate interpretable biomarkers, including network energy entropy, graph curvature, fractional memory indices, and modality-specific attention scores. These biomarkers are combined into a composite prognostic index to quantify individual risk of network instability or cognitive decline. Experiments on longitudinal neuroimaging datasets demonstrate both predictive accuracy and interpretability. The results highlight the potential of mathematically rigorous, multimodal graph-based approaches for deriving clinically meaningful biomarkers from existing imaging data without requiring new data collection.",

This work explores whether LLMs can serve not only as moderators that detect harmful content, but as mediators capable of understanding and de-escalating online conflicts. Our framework decomposes mediation into two subtasks: judgment, where an LLM evaluates the fairness and emotional dynamics of a conversation, and steering, where it generates empathetic, de-escalatory messages to guide participants toward resolution. To assess mediation quality, we construct a large Reddit-based dataset and propose a multi-stage evaluation pipeline combining principle-based scoring, user simulation, and human comparison. Experiments show that API-based models outperform open-source counterparts in both reasoning and intervention alignment when doing mediation. Our findings highlight both the promise and limitations of current LLMs as emerging agents for online social mediation.",

    "abstract": "Chunking has emerged as a critical technique that enhances generative models by grounding their responses in efficiently segmented knowledge [1]. While initially developed for unimodal (primarily textual) domains, recent advances in multimodal foundation models have extended chunking approaches to incorporate diverse data types, including images, audio, and video [2]. A critical component underpinning the success of these systems is the chunking strategy how large, continuous streams of multimodal data are segmented into semantically meaningful units suitable for processing [3]. Despite its importance, chunking remains an under-explored area, especially in the context of multimodal systems where modality-specific constraints, semantic preservation, and alignment across modalities introduce unique challenges.  Our goal is to consolidating the landscape of multimodal chunking strategies, providing researchers and practitioners with a technical foundation and design space for developing more effective and efficient multimodal AI systems. This survey paves the way for innovations in robust chunking pipelines that scale with modality complexity, enhance processing accuracy, and improve generative coherence in real-world applications. This survey provides a comprehensive taxonomy and technical analysis of chunking strategies tailored for each modality: text, images, audio, video, and cross-modal data. We examine classical and modern approaches such as fixed-size token windowing, recursive text splitting, object-centric visual chunking, silence-based audio segmentation, and scene detection in videos. Each approach is analyzed in terms of its underlying methodology, supporting tools (e.g., LangChain, Detectron2, PySceneDetect), benefits, and challenges, particularly those related to granularity-context trade-offs and multimodal alignment. Furthermore, we explore emerging cross-modal chunking strategies that aim to preserve alignment and semantic consistency across disparate data types [4]. We also include comparative insights, highlight open problems such as asynchronous information density and noisy alignment signals, and identify opportunities for future research in adaptive, learning-based, and task-specific chunking.",

However, current approaches remain limited by rigid action schemas and high annotation costs, restricting their ability to model diverse in-game interactions and player-driven dynamics. To address these challenges, we introduce Hunyuan-GameCraft-2, a new paradigm of instruction-driven interaction for generative game world modeling. Instead of relying on fixed keyboard inputs, our model allows users to control game video contents through natural language prompts, keyboard, or mouse signals, enabling flexible and semantically rich interaction within generated worlds. We formally defined the concept of interactive video data and developed an automated process to transform large-scale, unstructured text-video pairs into causally aligned interactive datasets. Built upon a 14B image-to-video Mixture-of-Experts(MoE) foundation model, our model incorporates a text-driven interaction injection mechanism for fine-grained control over camera motion, character behavior, and environment dynamics. We introduce an interaction-focused benchmark, InterBench, to evaluate interaction performance comprehensively. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model generates temporally coherent and causally grounded interactive game videos that faithfully respond to diverse and free-form user instructions such as \"open the door\", \"draw a torch\", or \"trigger an explosion\".",

This comes in contrast to the many proposals that already exist to purchase features and examples. By originally formalising the market clearing as an optimisation problem, we integrate budget constraints and improvement thresholds into the label acquisition process. We focus on a single-buyer-multiple-seller setup and propose the use of two active learning strategies (variance based and query-by-committee based), paired with distinct pricing mechanisms. They are compared to benchmark baselines including random sampling and a greedy knapsack heuristic. The proposed strategies are validated on real-world datasets from two critical application domains: real estate pricing and energy forecasting. Results demonstrate the robustness of our approach, consistently achieving superior performance with fewer labels acquired compared to conventional methods.

    "abstract": "Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have shown great promise for embodied AI, yet the heavy computational cost of processing continuous visual streams severely limits their real-time deployment. Token pruning (keeping salient visual tokens and dropping redundant ones) has emerged as an effective approach for accelerating Vision-Language Models (VLMs), offering a solution for efficient VLA. However, these VLM-specific token pruning methods select tokens based solely on semantic salience metrics (e.g., prefill attention), while overlooking the VLA's intrinsic dual-system nature of high-level semantic understanding and low-level action execution. Consequently, these methods bias token retention toward semantic cues, discard critical information for action generation, and significantly degrade VLA performance. To bridge this gap, we propose VLA-Pruner, a versatile plug-and-play VLA-specific token prune method that aligns with the dual-system nature of VLA models and exploits the temporal continuity in robot manipulation. Specifically, VLA-Pruner adopts a dual-level importance criterion for visual token retention: vision-language prefill attention for semantic-level relevance and action decode attention, estimated via temporal smoothing, for action-level importance. Based on this criterion, VLA-Pruner proposes a novel dual-level token selection strategy that adaptively preserves a compact, informative set of visual tokens for both semantic understanding and action execution under given compute budget. Experiments show that VLA-Pruner achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple VLA architectures and diverse robotic tasks.",

    "abstract": "Controlled generation imposes sequence-level constraints (syntax, style, safety) that depend on future tokens, making exact conditioning of an autoregressive LM intractable. Tractable surrogates such as HMMs can approximate continuation distributions and steer decoding, but standard surrogates are often weakly context-aware. We propose Learning to Look Ahead (LTLA), a hybrid method that uses base-LM embeddings to condition a globally learned tractable surrogate: a neural head predicts only a prefix-dependent latent prior, while a shared HMM answers continuation queries exactly. LTLA is designed to avoid two common efficiency traps when adding neural context. First, it avoids vocabulary-sized prefix rescoring (V extra LM evaluations) by scoring all next-token candidates via a single batched HMM forward update. Second, it avoids predicting a new HMM per prefix by learning one shared HMM and conditioning only the latent prior, which enables reuse of cached future-likelihood (backward) messages across decoding steps. Empirically, LTLA improves continuation likelihood over standard HMM surrogates, enables lookahead control for vision--language models by incorporating continuous context, achieves 100% syntactic constraint satisfaction, and improves detoxification while adding only a 14% decoding-time overhead.",

    "abstract": "Image-based virtual try-on (VTON) aims to synthesize photorealistic images of a person wearing specified garments. Despite significant progress, building a universal VTON framework that can flexibly handle diverse and complex tasks remains a major challenge. Recent methods explore multi-task VTON frameworks guided by textual instructions, yet they still face two key limitations: (1) semantic gap between text instructions and reference images, and (2) data scarcity in complex scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose UniFit, a universal VTON framework driven by a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM). Specifically, we introduce an MLLM-Guided Semantic Alignment Module (MGSA), which integrates multimodal inputs using an MLLM and a set of learnable queries. By imposing a semantic alignment loss, MGSA captures cross-modal semantic relationships and provides coherent and explicit semantic guidance for the generative process, thereby reducing the semantic gap. Moreover, by devising a two-stage progressive training strategy with a self-synthesis pipeline, UniFit is able to learn complex tasks from limited data. Extensive experiments show that UniFit not only supports a wide range of VTON tasks, including multi-garment and model-to-model try-on, but also achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Although recent text-prompt-based segmentation approaches enhance user-driven and reasoning-based segmentation, they remain confined to single-round dialogues and fail to perform multi-round reasoning. In this work, we introduce Multi-Round Entity-Level Medical Reasoning Segmentation (MEMR-Seg), a new task that requires generating segmentation masks through multi-round queries with entity-level reasoning. To support this task, we construct MR-MedSeg, a large-scale dataset of 177K multi-round medical segmentation dialogues, featuring entity-based reasoning across rounds. Furthermore, we propose MediRound, an effective baseline model designed for multi-round medical reasoning segmentation. To mitigate the inherent error propagation in the chain-like pipeline of multi-round segmentation, we introduce a lightweight yet effective Judgment & Correction Mechanism during model inference. Experimental results demonstrate that our method effectively addresses the MEMR-Seg task and outperforms conventional medical referring segmentation methods.",

We formulate this task through the least-squares quasiconformal (LSQC) operator and establish key structural properties of the LSQC minimizer, including well-posedness under mild conditions, invariance under similarity transformations, and resolution-independent behavior with stability under mesh refinement. We further analyze the sensitivity of the LSQC solution with respect to the Beltrami coefficient, establishing stability and differentiability properties that enable gradient-based optimization over the space of Beltrami coefficients. To make this differentiable formulation practical at scale and to facilitate the optimization process, we introduce the Spectral Beltrami Network (SBN), a multiscale mesh-spectral surrogate that approximates the LSQC solution operator in a single differentiable forward pass. This yields SBN-Opt, an optimization framework that searches over admissible Beltrami coefficients and pinning conditions to solve free-boundary diffeomorphism objectives with explicit distortion control.

As models develop induction heads, they experience a sharp drop in training loss, a phenomenon cited as evidence that induction heads may underlie a wide range of in-context learning (ICL) capabilities. In this work, we investigate whether induction heads are a necessary building block for learning abstractive ICL capabilities (i.e., tasks where the answer is not contained in the input context), or whether such capabilities can emerge independently. We propose Hapax, a training regime that omits the loss contribution of tokens predictable by induction heads. Despite a significant reduction in inductive copying, abstractive ICL capabilities are preserved, with the model achieving higher accuracy than the vanilla model on 13 out of 21 tasks, even though 31.7% of tokens are omitted from the loss. Furthermore, our model achieves lower loss values on token positions that induction heads cannot predict. Mechanistic analysis shows that models trained with Hapax develop fewer and weaker induction heads despite preserving abstractive ICL capabilities. Our findings suggest that the developmental link between induction heads and abstractive ICL capabilities is weaker than previously hypothesized.",

However, this mechanism can introduce lip leakage, where generated lips are influenced by the reference image rather than solely by the driving audio. Such leakage is difficult to detect with standard metrics and conventional test setup. To address this, we propose a systematic evaluation methodology to analyze and quantify lip leakage. Our framework employs three complementary test setups: silent-input generation, mismatched audio-video pairing, and matched audio-video synthesis. We also introduce derived metrics including lip-sync discrepancy and silent-audio-based lip-sync scores. In addition, we study how different identity reference selections affect leakage, providing insights into reference design. The proposed methodology is model-agnostic and establishes a more reliable benchmark for future research in talking face generation.",

However, most existing methods struggle with complex, long-horizon tasks because they rely on a monolithic trajectory that entangles all past decisions and observations to solve the entire task in a single unified process. To address this limitation, we propose ReAcTree, a hierarchical task-planning method that decomposes a complex goal into manageable subgoals within a dynamically constructed agent tree. Each subgoal is handled by an LLM agent node capable of reasoning, acting, and further expanding the tree, while control flow nodes coordinate the execution strategies of agent nodes. In addition, we integrate two complementary memory systems: each agent node retrieves goal-specific, subgoal-level examples from episodic memory and shares environment-specific observations through working memory. Experiments on the WAH-NL and ALFRED show ReAcTree consistently outperforms strong task-planning baselines such as ReAct across diverse LLMs. Notably, on WAH-NL, ReAcTree achieves a 61% goal success rate with Qwen 2.5 72B, nearly doubling ReAct's 31%.

    "abstract": "Initialization of neural network parameters, such as weights and biases, has a crucial impact on learning performance; if chosen well, we can even avoid the need for additional training with backpropagation. For example, algorithms based on the ridgelet transform or the SWIM (sampling where it matters) concept have been proposed for initialization. On the other hand, some works show hierarchical features in trained neural networks; neural networks tend to learn coarse information in the early-stage hidden layers. In this work, we investigate the effects of utilizing information on the hierarchical features in the initialization of neural networks. Hence, we propose a framework that adjusts the scale factors in the SWIM algorithm to capture low-frequency components in the early-stage hidden layers and to represent high-frequency components in the late-stage hidden layers. Numerical experiments on a one-dimensional regression task and the MNIST classification task demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the conventional initialization algorithms. This work clarifies the importance of intrinsic hierarchical features in learning neural networks, and the finding yields an effective parameter initialization strategy that enhances their training performance.",

Unlike instruction-tuned models trained on static data, our method acquires diagnostic strategies through dynamic exploration and outcome-based feedback, mapping evolving patient states to the next optimal examination and subsequent diagnosis. Our contributions include: (i) DiagGym, a diagnostics world model trained with electronic health records, serving as a virtual clinical environment to support closed-loop in-silico training and evaluation for interactive diagnosis; (ii) DiagAgent, trained via end-to-end multi-turn RL to learn dynamic diagnostic policies that optimize both interactive effectiveness and final accuracy; (iii) DiagBench, a multi-center diagnostic benchmark designed to evaluate multi-turn diagnostic interaction trajectories. The benchmark comprises 2.2K physician-validated cases sourced from 4 distinct distributions, alongside 3.3K physician-written rubrics for granular process-oriented evaluation. (iv) Extensive evaluations demonstrate DiagAgent's superior performance across both in-domain and out-of-domain (OOD) settings. DiagAgent significantly outperforms 11 SOTA LLMs and 2 prompt-engineered agents. In the end-to-end setting, it delivers a 11.20% increase in diagnostic accuracy and a 17.58% boost in examination recommendation F1 score, while consistently maintaining SOTA performance across all three external centers. Furthermore, in rubric-based evaluations, it surpasses the next-best model by 7.1% in weighted rubric score. These findings indicate that learning policies in interactive clinical environments confers long-term diagnostic management abilities unattainable through passive training.",

    "abstract": "Autoformalization, which translates natural language mathematics into machine-verifiable formal statements, is critical for using formal mathematical reasoning to solve math problems stated in natural language. While Large Language Models can generate syntactically correct formal statements, they often fail to preserve the original problem's semantic intent. This limitation arises from the LLM approaches' treating autoformalization as a simplistic translation task which lacks mechanisms for self-reflection and iterative refinement that human experts naturally employ. To address these issues, we propose ReForm, a Reflective Autoformalization method that tightly integrates semantic consistency evaluation into the autoformalization process. This enables the model to iteratively generate formal statements, assess its semantic fidelity, and self-correct identified errors through progressive refinement. To effectively train this reflective model, we introduce Prospective Bounded Sequence Optimization (PBSO), which employs different rewards at different sequence positions to ensure that the model develops both accurate autoformalization and correct semantic validations, preventing superficial critiques that would undermine the purpose of reflection. Extensive experiments across four autoformalization benchmarks demonstrate that ReForm achieves an average improvement of 22.6 percentage points over the strongest baselines. To further ensure evaluation reliability, we introduce ConsistencyCheck, a benchmark of 859 expert-annotated items that not only validates LLMs as judges but also reveals that autoformalization is inherently difficult: even human experts produce semantic errors in up to 38.5% of cases.",

    "abstract": "Alignment of large language models (LLMs) has predominantly relied on pairwise preference optimization, where annotators select the better of two responses to a prompt. While simple, this approach overlooks the opportunity to learn from richer forms of human feedback, such as multiway comparisons and top-$k$ rankings. We introduce Ranked Choice Preference Optimization (RCPO), a unified framework that bridges preference optimization with (ranked) choice modeling via maximum likelihood estimation. RCPO supports both utility-based and rank-based models, subsumes several pairwise methods (such as DPO and SimPO) as special cases, and provides principled training objectives for richer feedback formats. We instantiate this framework with two representative models (Multinomial Logit and Mallows-RMJ). Experiments on Llama-3-8B-Instruct, Gemma-2-9B-it, and Mistral-7B-Instruct across in-distribution and out-of-distribution settings show that RCPO consistently outperforms competitive baselines. RCPO shows that directly leveraging ranked preference data, combined with the right choice models, yields more effective alignment. It offers an extensible foundation for incorporating (ranked) choice modeling into LLM training.",

    "abstract": "Although membership inference attacks (MIAs) and machine-generated text detection target different goals, their methods often exploit similar signals based on a language model's probability distribution, and the two tasks have been studied independently. This can result in conclusions that overlook stronger methods and valuable insights from the other task. In this work, we theoretically and empirically demonstrate the transferability, i.e., how well a method originally developed for one task performs on the other, between MIAs and machine text detection. We prove that the metric achieving asymptotically optimal performance is identical for both tasks. We unify existing methods under this optimal metric and hypothesize that the accuracy with which a method approximates this metric is directly correlated with its transferability. Our large-scale empirical experiments demonstrate very strong rank correlation ($ρ\\approx 0.7$) in cross-task performance. Notably, we also find that a machine text detector achieves the strongest performance among evaluated methods on both tasks, demonstrating the practical impact of transferability. To facilitate cross-task development and fair evaluation, we introduce MINT, a unified evaluation suite for MIAs and machine-generated text detection, implementing 15 recent methods from both tasks.",

    "abstract": "The classical policy gradient method is the theoretical and conceptual foundation of modern policy-based reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms. Most rigorous analyses of such methods, particularly those establishing convergence guarantees, assume a discount factor $γ< 1$. In contrast, however, a recent line of work on policy-based RL for large language models uses the undiscounted total-reward setting with $γ= 1$, rendering much of the existing theory inapplicable. In this paper, we provide analyses of the policy gradient method for undiscounted expected total-reward infinite-horizon MDPs based on two key insights: (i) the classification of the MDP states into recurrent and transient states is invariant over the set of policies that assign strictly positive probability to every action (as is typical in deep RL models employing a softmax output layer) and (ii) the classical state visitation measure (which may be ill-defined when $γ= 1$) can be replaced with a new object that we call the transient visitation measure.",

    "abstract": "Multimodal learning integrates diverse modalities but suffers from modality imbalance, where dominant modalities suppress weaker ones due to inconsistent convergence rates. Existing methods predominantly rely on static modulation or heuristics, overlooking sample-level distributional variations in prediction bias. Specifically, they fail to distinguish outlier samples where the modality gap is exacerbated by low data quality. We propose a framework to quantitatively diagnose and dynamically mitigate this imbalance at the sample level. We introduce the Modality Gap metric to quantify prediction discrepancies. Analysis reveals that this gap follows a bimodal distribution, indicating the coexistence of balanced and imbalanced sample subgroups. We employ a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to explicitly model this distribution, leveraging Bayesian posterior probabilities for soft subgroup separation. Our two-stage framework comprises a Warm-up stage and an Adaptive Training stage. In the latter, a GMM-guided Adaptive Loss dynamically reallocates optimization priorities: it imposes stronger alignment penalties on imbalanced samples to rectify bias, while prioritizing fusion for balanced samples to maximize complementary information. Experiments on CREMA-D, AVE, and KineticSound demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms SOTA baselines. Furthermore, we show that fine-tuning on a GMM-filtered balanced subset serves as an effective data purification strategy, yielding substantial gains by eliminating extreme noisy samples even without the adaptive loss.",

To address these challenges, we propose SHIELD, a training-free framework that mitigates hallucinations through three strategies: re-weighting visual tokens to reduce statistical bias, introducing noise-derived tokens to counter inherent bias, and applying adversarial attacks with contrastive decoding to address vulnerability. Experiments demonstrate that SHIELD effectively mitigates object hallucinations across diverse benchmarks and LVLM families. Moreover, SHIELD achieves strong performance on the general LVLM benchmark, highlighting its broad applicability. Code is available at https://github.com/hukcc/SHIELD.",

    "abstract": "This paper investigates the recently emerged problem of Language-assisted Image Clustering (LaIC), where textual semantics are leveraged to improve the discriminability of visual representations to facilitate image clustering. Due to the unavailability of true class names, one of core challenges of LaIC lies in how to filter positive nouns, i.e., those semantically close to the images of interest, from unlabeled wild corpus data. Existing filtering strategies are predominantly based on the off-the-shelf feature space learned by CLIP; however, despite being intuitive, these strategies lack a rigorous theoretical foundation. To fill this gap, we propose a novel gradient-based framework, termed as GradNorm, which is theoretically guaranteed and shows strong empirical performance. In particular, we measure the positiveness of each noun based on the magnitude of gradients back-propagated from the cross-entropy between the predicted target distribution and the softmax output. Theoretically, we provide a rigorous error bound to quantify the separability of positive nouns by GradNorm and prove that GradNorm naturally subsumes existing filtering strategies as extremely special cases of itself. Empirically, extensive experiments show that GradNorm achieves the state-of-the-art clustering performance on various benchmarks.",

    "abstract": "Although large language models (LLMs) have made significant strides across various tasks, they still face significant challenges in complex reasoning and planning. For example, even with carefully designed prompts and prior information explicitly provided, GPT-4o achieves only a 7% Final Pass Rate on the TravelPlanner dataset in the sole-planning mode. Similarly, even in the thinking mode, Qwen3-8B-Instruct and DeepSeek-R1-671B, only achieve Final Pass Rates of 5.9% and 40%, respectively. Although well-organized Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) can offer improved collective reasoning, they often suffer from high reasoning costs due to multi-round internal interactions, long per-response latency, and difficulties in end-to-end training. To address these challenges, we propose a general and scalable framework called IMAGINE, short for Integrating Multi-Agent System into One Model. This framework not only integrates the reasoning and planning capabilities of MAS into a single, compact model, but also significantly surpass the capabilities of the MAS through a simple end-to-end training. Through this pipeline, a single small-scale model is not only able to acquire the structured reasoning and planning capabilities of a well-organized MAS but can also significantly outperform it. Experimental results demonstrate that, when using Qwen3-8B-Instruct as the base model and training it with our method, the model achieves an 82.7% Final Pass Rate on the TravelPlanner benchmark, far exceeding the 40% of DeepSeek-R1-671B, while maintaining a much smaller model size.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we broaden the horizon of online convex optimization (OCO), and consider multi-objective OCO, where there are $K$ distinct loss function sequences, and an algorithm has to choose its action at time $t$, before the $K$ loss functions at time $t$ are revealed. To capture the tradeoff between tracking the $K$ different sequences, we consider the {\\it min-max} regret, where the benchmark (optimal offline algorithm) takes a static action across all time slots that minimizes the maximum of the total loss (summed across time slots) incurred by each of the $K$ sequences. An online algorithm is allowed to change its action across time slots, and its {\\it min-max} regret is defined as the difference between its {\\it min-max} cost and that of the benchmark. The {\\it min-max} regret is a stringent performance measure and an algorithm with small regret needs to `track' all loss functions simultaneously.   We first show that with adversarial input, {\\it min-max} regret scales linearly with the time horizon $T$ for any online algorithm. Consequently, we consider a stochastic i.i.d. input model where all loss functions are i.i.d. generated from an unknown joint distribution and propose a simple algorithm that combines the well-known {\\it Hedge} and online gradient descent (OGD) and show via a remarkably simple proof that its expected {\\it min-max} regret is $O(\\sqrt{T \\log (T K)})$. Analogous results are also derived for Martingale difference and Markov input models.",

Existing neural tokenizers fail to preserve high-frequency dynamics, limiting their ability to reconstruct EEG signals with high fidelity. We introduce NeuroRVQ, a scalable Large Brainwave Model (LBM) centered on a codebook-based tokenizer. Our tokenizer integrates: (i) multi-scale feature extraction modules that capture the full frequency neural spectrum; (ii) hierarchical residual vector quantization (RVQ) codebooks for high-resolution encoding; and, (iii) an EEG signal phase- and amplitude-aware loss function for efficient training. This design enables efficient EEG compression while supporting accurate reconstruction across all frequency bands, leading to robust generative masked modeling. Our empirical results demonstrate that NeuroRVQ achieves lower reconstruction error and outperforms existing LBMs on a variety of downstream tasks. More broadly, NeuroRVQ tokenizer establishes a strong prior for codebook-based general-purpose brainwave models, enabling advances in neural decoding, generative modeling and multimodal biosignal integration.",

We address this challenge by presenting a scalable pipeline for automating grammatical annotation in voluminous corpora using large language models (LLMs). Unlike previous supervised and iterative approaches, our method employs a four-phase workflow: prompt engineering, pre-hoc evaluation, automated batch processing, and post-hoc validation. We demonstrate the pipeline's accessibility and effectiveness through a diachronic case study of variation in the English evaluative consider construction (consider X as/to be/zero Y). We annotate 143,933 'consider' concordance lines from the Corpus of Historical American English (COHA) via the OpenAI API in under 60 hours, achieving 98 percent+ accuracy on two sophisticated annotation procedures. A Bayesian multinomial GAM fitted to 44,527 true positives of the evaluative construction reveals previously undocumented genre-specific trajectories of change, enabling us to advance new hypotheses about the relationship between register formality and competing pressures of morphosyntactic reduction and enhancement. Our results suggest that LLMs can perform a range of data preparation tasks at scale with minimal human intervention, unlocking substantive research questions previously beyond practical reach, though implementation requires attention to costs, licensing, and other ethical considerations.",

    "abstract": "Interactive 3D point cloud segmentation enables efficient annotation of complex 3D scenes through user-guided prompts. However, current approaches are typically restricted in scope to a single domain (indoor or outdoor), and to a single form of user interaction (either spatial clicks or textual prompts). Moreover, training on multiple datasets often leads to negative transfer, resulting in domain-specific tools that lack generalizability. To address these limitations, we present SNAP (Segment aNything in Any Point cloud), a unified model for interactive 3D segmentation that supports both point-based and text-based prompts across diverse domains. Our approach achieves cross-domain generalizability by training on 7 datasets spanning indoor, outdoor, and aerial environments, while employing domain-adaptive normalization to prevent negative transfer. For text-prompted segmentation, we automatically generate mask proposals without human intervention and match them against CLIP embeddings of textual queries, enabling both panoptic and open-vocabulary segmentation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SNAP consistently delivers high-quality segmentation results. We achieve state-of-the-art performance on 8 out of 9 zero-shot benchmarks for spatial-prompted segmentation and demonstrate competitive results on all 5 text-prompted benchmarks. These results show that a unified model can match or exceed specialized domain-specific approaches, providing a practical tool for scalable 3D annotation.

    "abstract": "We present UGround, a \\textbf{U}nified visual \\textbf{Ground}ing paradigm that dynamically selects intermediate layers across \\textbf{U}nrolled transformers as ``mask as prompt'', diverging from the prevailing pipeline that leverages the fixed last hidden layer as ``\\texttt{<SEG>} as prompt''. UGround addresses two primary challenges posed by the prevailing paradigm: (1) its reliance on the fixed last hidden layer, which sequentially amplifies cumulative errors arising from layer-by-layer propagation without intermediate correction, and (2) its use of \\texttt{<SEG>} as a prompt, which implicitly projects textual embeddings into visual space without explicit spatial cues (\\eg, coordinates). Central to UGround is Policy-Prompted Masking, which comprises two key components: Stochastic Skip Connection (SSC) and Mask as Prompt (MasP). SSC is a reinforcement learning policy that, via stochastic sampling, allows each \\texttt{<SEG>} token to slide across unrolled transformer layers, enabling dynamic layer selection at which it connects to the vision model (\\eg, SAM) in a skip-connection fashion. Given the selected hidden layer, MasP uses the similarity map derived from the \\texttt{<SEG>} token and image tokens as a soft logit mask to prompt SAM for mask generation, offering explicit spatial cues through its activation regions. To validate the effectiveness of UGround, we, for the first time, have unified visual grounding within a single framework from an attribute perspective, spanning from traditional refer expression segmentation to newly proposed reasoning segmentation, single-target to multi-target, positive query to false premise (empty target).

    "abstract": "Post-training for large language models (LLMs) is constrained by the high cost of acquiring new knowledge or correcting errors and by the unintended side effects that frequently arise from retraining. To address these issues, we introduce REPAIR (Robust Editing via Progressive Adaptive Intervention and Reintegration), a lifelong editing framework designed to support precise and low-cost model updates while preserving non-target knowledge. REPAIR mitigates the instability and conflicts of large-scale sequential edits through a closed-loop feedback mechanism coupled with dynamic memory management. Furthermore, by incorporating frequent knowledge fusion and enforcing strong locality guards, REPAIR effectively addresses the shortcomings of traditional distribution-agnostic approaches that often overlook unintended ripple effects. Our experiments demonstrate that REPAIR boosts editing accuracy by 10%-30% across multiple model families and significantly reduces knowledge forgetting. This work introduces a robust framework for developing reliable, scalable, and continually evolving LLMs.",

    "abstract": "Although current large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have advanced in multimodal understanding and reasoning, their fundamental perceptual and reasoning abilities remain limited. Specifically, even on simple jigsaw tasks, existing VLMs perform near randomly, revealing deficiencies in core perception and reasoning capabilities. While high-quality vision-language data can enhance these capabilities, its scarcity and limited scalability impose significant constraints. To address this, we propose AGILE, an Agentic jiGsaw Interaction Learning for Enhancing visual perception and reasoning in VLMs. AGILE formulates jigsaw solving as an interactive process, enabling the model to progressively engage with the environment. At each step, the model generates executable code to perform an action based on the current state, while the environment provides fine-grained visual feedback to guide task completion. Through this iterative cycle of observation and interaction, the model incrementally improves its perceptual and reasoning capabilities via exploration and feedback. Experimental results show that AGILE not only substantially boosts performance on jigsaw tasks of varying complexity (e.g., increasing accuracy from 9.5% to 82.8% under the 2 $\\times$ 2 setting) but also demonstrates strong generalization across 9 general vision tasks, achieving an average improvement of 3.1%. These results indicate notable enhancements in both perceptual and reasoning abilities. This work opens a new avenue for advancing reasoning and generalization in multimodal models and provides an efficient, scalable solution to the scarcity of multimodal reinforcement learning data.

    "abstract": "Positive-Unlabeled (PU) learning aims to train a binary classifier (positive vs. negative) where only limited positive data and abundant unlabeled data are available. While widely applicable, state-of-the-art PU learning methods substantially underperform their supervised counterparts on complex datasets, especially without auxiliary negatives or pre-estimated parameters (e.g., a 14.26% gap on CIFAR-100 dataset). We identify the primary bottleneck as the challenge of learning discriminative representations under unreliable supervision. To tackle this challenge, we propose NcPU, a non-contrastive PU learning framework that requires no auxiliary information. NcPU combines a noisy-pair robust supervised non-contrastive loss (NoiSNCL), which aligns intra-class representations despite unreliable supervision, with a phantom label disambiguation (PLD) scheme that supplies conservative negative supervision via regret-based label updates. Theoretically, NoiSNCL and PLD can iteratively benefit each other from the perspective of the Expectation-Maximization framework. Empirically, extensive experiments demonstrate that: (1) NoiSNCL enables simple PU methods to achieve competitive performance; and (2) NcPU achieves substantial improvements over state-of-the-art PU methods across diverse datasets, including challenging datasets on post-disaster building damage mapping, highlighting its promise for real-world applications.

    "abstract": "Prompt-based methods have recently gained prominence in Continual Learning (CL) due to their strong performance and memory efficiency. A prevalent strategy in this paradigm assigns a dedicated subset of prompts to each task, which, while effective, incurs substantial computational overhead and causes memory requirements to scale linearly with the number of tasks. Conversely, approaches employing a single shared prompt across tasks offer greater efficiency but often suffer from degraded performance due to knowledge interference. To reconcile this trade-off, we propose SMoPE, a novel framework that integrates the benefits of both task-specific and shared prompt strategies. Inspired by recent findings on the relationship between Prefix Tuning and Mixture of Experts (MoE), SMoPE organizes a shared prompt into multiple \"prompt experts\" within a sparse MoE architecture. For each input, only a select subset of relevant experts is activated, effectively mitigating interference. To facilitate expert selection, we introduce a prompt-attention score aggregation mechanism that computes a unified proxy score for each expert, enabling dynamic and sparse activation. Additionally, we propose an adaptive noise mechanism to encourage balanced expert utilization while preserving knowledge from prior tasks. To further enhance expert specialization, we design a prototype-based loss function that leverages prefix keys as implicit memory representations. Extensive experiments across multiple CL benchmarks demonstrate that SMoPE consistently outperforms task-specific prompt methods and achieves performance competitive with state-of-the-art approaches, all while significantly reducing parameter counts and computational costs.",

    "abstract": "Training LLM agents in multi-turn environments with sparse rewards, where completing a single task requires 30+ turns of interaction within an episode, presents a fundamental challenge for reinforcement learning. We identify a critical failure mode unique to this setting: the exploration-exploitation cascade failure. This cascade begins with early-stage policy premature convergence, where sparse feedback causes agents to commit to flawed, low-entropy strategies. Subsequently, agents enter late-stage policy collapse, where conventional entropy regularization becomes counterproductive, promoting chaotic exploration that destabilizes training. We propose Entropy-regularized Policy Optimization (EPO), a general framework that breaks this failure cycle through three synergistic mechanisms: (1) adopting entropy regularization in multi-turn settings to enhance exploration, (2) an entropy smoothing regularizer that bounds policy entropy within historical averages to prevent abrupt fluctuations, and (3) adaptive phase-based weighting that balances exploration and exploitation across training. Our analysis justifies that EPO guarantees monotonically decreasing entropy variance while maintaining convergence. EPO achieves up to 152% performance improvement on ScienceWorld and up to 19.8% on ALFWorld. Our work demonstrates that multi-turn sparse-reward settings require fundamentally different entropy control than traditional RL, with broad implications for LLM agent training.",

However, existing reasoning-based methods for image generation either restrict reasoning to a single modality (image or text) or rely on high-quality reasoning data for fine-tuning. To tackle these limitations, we propose MILR, a test-time method that jointly reasons over image and text in a unified latent vector space. Reasoning in MILR is performed by searching through vector representations of discrete image and text tokens. Practically, this is implemented via the policy gradient method, guided by an image quality critic. We instantiate MILR within the unified multimodal understanding and generation (MUG) framework that natively supports language reasoning before image synthesis and thus facilitates cross-modal reasoning. The intermediate model outputs, which are to be optimized, serve as the unified latent space, enabling MILR to operate entirely at test time. We evaluate MILR on GenEval, T2I-CompBench, and WISE, achieving state-of-the-art results on all benchmarks. Notably, on knowledge-intensive WISE, MILR attains an overall score of 0.63, improving over the baseline by 80%. Our further analysis indicates that joint reasoning in the unified latent space is the key to its strong performance. Moreover, our qualitative studies reveal MILR's non-trivial ability in temporal and cultural reasoning, highlighting the efficacy of our reasoning method.",

In general, building a graph-level prediction model achieving high discriminative ability along with interpretability is still a challenging problem. Our combination of the subgraph enumeration and neural network contributes to high discriminative ability about the subgraph structure of the input graph. Further, the sparse regularization in EIN enables us 1) to derive an effective pruning strategy that mitigates computational difficulty of the enumeration while maintaining the prediction performance, and 2) to identify important subgraphs that contributes to high interpretability. We empirically show that EIN has sufficiently high prediction performance compared with standard graph neural network models, and also, we show examples of post-hoc analysis based on the selected subgraphs.",

    "abstract": "Text-to-image diffusion models, such as Stable Diffusion, can produce high-quality and diverse images but often fail to achieve compositional alignment, particularly when prompts describe complex object relationships, attributes, or spatial arrangements. Recent inference-time approaches address this by optimizing or exploring the initial noise under the guidance of reward functions that score text-image alignment without requiring model fine-tuning. While promising, each strategy has intrinsic limitations when used alone: optimization can stall due to poor initialization or unfavorable search trajectories, whereas exploration may require a prohibitively large number of samples to locate a satisfactory output. Our analysis further shows that neither single reward metrics nor ad-hoc combinations reliably capture all aspects of compositionality, leading to weak or inconsistent guidance. To overcome these challenges, we present Category-Aware Reward-based Initial Noise Optimization and Exploration (CARINOX), a unified framework that combines noise optimization and exploration with a principled reward selection procedure grounded in correlation with human judgments. Evaluations on two complementary benchmarks covering diverse compositional challenges show that CARINOX raises average alignment scores by +16% on T2I-CompBench++ and +11% on the HRS benchmark, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art optimization and exploration-based methods across all major categories, while preserving image quality and diversity.

However, the impact of SFT on a model's knowledge remains underexplored, limiting our ability to control knowledge change behavior in fine-tuned models. To address this gap, we evaluate closed-book question answering (CBQA) performance across five LLMs from the LLaMA-2 and LLaMA-3 families. Surprisingly, models fine-tuned on 1,920 samples perform up to 14% worse than those fine-tuned on only 240 samples. Furthermore, varying the level of knowledge mastery in the fine-tuning data leads to performance fluctuations of over 12%. To investigate these effects, we analyze model behavior at both the token and parameter levels. Our analysis reveals that up to 90% of parameter updates during SFT do not contribute to knowledge enhancement. Restoring these updates can improve performance on the CBQA task, depending on the characteristics of the fine-tuning data. These insights offer practical guidance for developing fine-tuning strategies that more effectively strengthen model knowledge.",

    "abstract": "Adapting billion-parameter language models to a downstream task is still costly, even with parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT). We re-cast task adaptation as output-distribution alignment: the objective is to steer the output distribution toward the task distribution directly during decoding rather than indirectly through weight updates. Building on this view, we introduce Steering Vector Decoding (SVDecode), a lightweight, PEFT-compatible, and theoretically grounded method. We start with a short warm-start fine-tune and extract a task-aware steering vector from the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence gradient between the output distribution of the warm-started and pre-trained models. This steering vector is then used to guide the decoding process to steer the model's output distribution towards the task distribution. We theoretically prove that SVDecode is first-order equivalent to the gradient step of full fine-tuning and derive a globally optimal solution for the strength of the steering vector. Across three tasks and nine benchmarks, SVDecode paired with four standard PEFT methods improves multiple-choice accuracy by up to 5 percentage points and open-ended truthfulness by 2 percentage points, with similar gains (1-2 percentage points) on commonsense datasets without adding trainable parameters beyond the PEFT adapter. SVDecode thus offers a lightweight, theoretically grounded path to stronger task adaptation for large language models. Code is available at https://github.com/dl-m9/SVDecode.",

We believe they hold strong promise for this domain. To unlock this potential, we explicitly align past and future representations, thereby bridging the distributional gap between input histories and future targets. To this end, we introduce TimeAlign, a lightweight, plug-and-play framework that establishes a new representation paradigm, distinct from contrastive learning, by aligning auxiliary features via a simple reconstruction task and feeding them back into any base forecaster. Extensive experiments across eight benchmarks verify its superior performance. Further studies indicate that the gains arise primarily from correcting frequency mismatches between historical inputs and future outputs. Additionally, we provide two theoretical justifications for how reconstruction improves forecasting generalization and how alignment increases the mutual information between learned representations and predicted targets.

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have made remarkable progress in mathematical reasoning, but still continue to struggle with high-precision tasks like numerical computation and formal symbolic manipulation. Integrating external tools has emerged as a promising approach to bridge this gap. Despite recent advances, existing methods struggle with three key challenges: constructing tool-integrated reasoning data, performing fine-grained optimization, and enhancing inference. To overcome these limitations, we propose THOR (Tool-Integrated Hierarchical Optimization via RL). First, we introduce TIRGen, a multi-agent based pipeline for constructing high-quality datasets of tool-integrated reasoning paths, aligning with the policy and generalizing well across diverse models. Second, to perform fine-grained hierarchical optimization, we introduce an RL strategy that jointly optimizes for both episode-level problem solving and step-level code generation. This is motivated by our key insight that the success of an intermediate tool call is a strong predictor of the final answer's correctness. Finally, THOR incorporates a self-correction mechanism that leverages immediate tool feedback to dynamically revise erroneous reasoning paths during inference. Our approach demonstrates strong generalization across diverse models, performing effectively in both reasoning and non-reasoning models. It further achieves state-of-the-art performance for models of a similar scale on multiple mathematical benchmarks, while also delivering consistent improvements on code benchmarks.

    "abstract": "Understanding human behavior traits is central to applications in human-computer interaction, computational social science, and personalized AI systems. Such understanding often requires integrating multiple modalities to capture nuanced patterns and relationships. However, existing resources rarely provide datasets that combine behavioral descriptors with complementary modalities such as facial attributes and biographical information. To address this gap, we present PersonaX, a curated collection of multimodal datasets designed to enable comprehensive analysis of public traits across modalities. PersonaX consists of (1) CelebPersona, featuring 9444 public figures from diverse occupations, and (2) AthlePersona, covering 4181 professional athletes across 7 major sports leagues. Each dataset includes behavioral trait assessments inferred by three high-performing large language models, alongside facial imagery and structured biographical features. We analyze PersonaX at two complementary levels. First, we abstract high-level trait scores from text descriptions and apply five statistical independence tests to examine their relationships with other modalities. Second, we introduce a novel causal representation learning (CRL) framework tailored to multimodal and multi-measurement data, providing theoretical identifiability guarantees. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world data demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. By unifying structured and unstructured analysis, PersonaX establishes a foundation for studying LLM-inferred behavioral traits in conjunction with visual and biographical attributes, advancing multimodal trait analysis and causal reasoning.

    "abstract": "Video-based AI systems are increasingly adopted in safety-critical domains such as autonomous driving and healthcare. However, interpreting their decisions remains challenging due to the inherent spatiotemporal complexity of video data and the opacity of deep learning models. Existing explanation techniques often suffer from limited temporal coherence and a lack of actionable causal insights. Current counterfactual explanation methods typically do not incorporate guidance from the target model, reducing semantic fidelity and practical utility. We introduce Latent Diffusion for Video Counterfactual Explanations (LD-ViCE), a novel framework designed to explain the behavior of video-based AI models. Compared to previous approaches, LD-ViCE reduces the computational costs of generating explanations by operating in latent space using a state-of-the-art diffusion model, while producing realistic and interpretable counterfactuals through an additional refinement step. Experiments on three diverse video datasets - EchoNet-Dynamic (cardiac ultrasound), FERV39k (facial expression), and Something-Something V2 (action recognition) with multiple target models covering both classification and regression tasks, demonstrate that LD-ViCE generalizes well and achieves state-of-the-art performance. On the EchoNet-Dynamic dataset, LD-ViCE achieves significantly higher regression accuracy than prior methods and exhibits high temporal consistency, while the refinement stage further improves perceptual quality. Qualitative analyses confirm that LD-ViCE produces semantically meaningful and temporally coherent explanations, providing actionable insights into model behavior. LD-ViCE advances the trustworthiness and interpretability of video-based AI systems through visually coherent counterfactual explanations.",

When faced with multi-step tool usage, LLMs still struggle with tool selection, parameter generation, and tool-chain planning. Existing methods typically rely on manually designing task-specific demonstrations, or retrieving from a curated library. These approaches demand substantial expert effort and prompt engineering becomes increasingly complex and inefficient as tool diversity and task difficulty scale. To address these challenges, we propose a self-guided method, Stepwise Experience Recall (SEER), which performs fine-grained, stepwise retrieval from a continually updated experience pool. Instead of relying on static or manually curated library, SEER incrementally augments the experience pool with past successful trajectories, enabling continuous expansion of the pool and improved model performance over time. Evaluated on the ToolQA benchmark, SEER achieves an average improvement of 6.1% on easy and 4.7% on hard questions. We further test SEER on $τ$-bench, which includes two real-world domains. Powered by Qwen2.5-7B and Qwen2.5-72B models, SEER demonstrates substantial accuracy gains of 7.44% and 23.38%, respectively.",

Active Feature Acquisition (AFA) addresses this challenge by dynamically selecting a subset of informative features for each data instance, trading predictive performance against acquisition cost.

In this paper, we introduce AFABench, the first benchmark framework for AFA. Our benchmark includes a diverse set of synthetic and real-world datasets, supports a wide range of acquisition policies, and provides a modular design that enables easy integration of new methods and tasks. We implement and evaluate representative algorithms from all major categories, including static, myopic, and reinforcement learning-based approaches. To test the lookahead capabilities of AFA policies, we introduce a novel synthetic dataset, CUBE-NM, designed to expose the limitations of myopic selection.

Our system encodes inputs through a grid-cell-like layer, followed by sparse pattern separation using a dentate gyrus-inspired module with top-k sparsity. Episodic memory traces are maintained in a CA3-like autoassociative memory. Task-specific processing is dynamically managed via a DG-gated mixture-of-experts mechanism, wherein inputs are routed to experts based on cosine similarity between their normalized sparse DG representations and learned task-specific DG prototypes computed through online exponential moving averages. This biologically grounded yet mathematically principled gating strategy enables differentiable, scalable task-routing without relying on a separate gating network, and enhances the model's adaptability and efficiency in learning multiple sequential tasks. Cortical outputs are consolidated using Elastic Weight Consolidation weighted by inter-task similarity. Crucially, we incorporate prioritized replay of stored patterns to reinforce essential past experiences. Evaluations on standard continual learning benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our architecture in reducing task interference, achieving near state-of-the-art results in continual learning tasks at lower computational costs.

However, most existing LLMs rely on autoregressive (AR) generation, producing one token at a time based on previously generated context-resulting in limited generation speed due to the inherently sequential nature of the process. To address this challenge, an increasing number of researchers have begun exploring parallel text generation-a broad class of techniques aimed at breaking the token-by-token generation bottleneck and improving inference efficiency. Despite growing interest, there remains a lack of comprehensive analysis on what specific techniques constitute parallel text generation and how they improve inference performance. To bridge this gap, we present a systematic survey of parallel text generation methods. We categorize existing approaches into AR-based and Non-AR-based paradigms, and provide a detailed examination of the core techniques within each category. Following this taxonomy, we assess their theoretical trade-offs in terms of speed, quality, and efficiency, and examine their potential for combination and comparison with alternative acceleration strategies. Finally, based on our findings, we highlight recent advancements, identify open challenges, and outline promising directions for future research in parallel text generation.

    "abstract": "Prompt optimization methods have demonstrated significant effectiveness in aligning black-box large language models (LLMs). In parallel, inference scaling strategies such as Best-of-N Sampling and Majority Voting have likewise been shown to improve alignment and performance by trading additional computation for better output. However, existing prompt optimization approaches are inference strategy agnostic; that is, they optimize prompts without accounting for the inference strategy. This constitutes a significant methodological gap, as our empirical and theoretical analysis reveals a strong interdependence between these two paradigms. Moreover, we find that user preferences regarding trade-offs among multiple objectives and inference budgets substantially influence the choice of prompt and inference configuration. To address this gap, we introduce a novel unified framework named IAPO (Inference-Aware Prompt Optimization) that jointly optimizes the prompt and inference scale, while being aware of the inference budget and different task objectives. We then develop a fixed-budget training algorithm for IAPO, called PSST (Prompt Scaling via Sequential Trimming), and establish finite-budget guarantees on the error probability. Finally, we evaluate the effectiveness of PSST on six tasks, including multi-objective text generation and reasoning, and demonstrate the critical role of incorporating inference-awareness in aligning black-box LLMs using prompt optimization.",

Despite the advances, existing studies have yet to delve thoroughly into fine-grained relationships within logit knowledge. In this paper, we propose Local Dense Relational Logit Distillation (LDRLD), a novel method that captures inter-class relationships through recursively decoupling and recombining logit information, thereby providing more detailed and clearer insights for student learning. To further optimize the performance, we introduce an Adaptive Decay Weight (ADW) strategy, which can dynamically adjust the weights for critical category pairs using Inverse Rank Weighting (IRW) and Exponential Rank Decay (ERD). Specifically, IRW assigns weights inversely proportional to the rank differences between pairs, while ERD adaptively controls weight decay based on total ranking scores of category pairs. Furthermore, after the recursive decoupling, we distill the remaining non-target knowledge to ensure knowledge completeness and enhance performance. Ultimately, our method improves the student's performance by transferring fine-grained knowledge and emphasizing the most critical relationships. Extensive experiments on datasets such as CIFAR-100, ImageNet-1K, and Tiny-ImageNet demonstrate that our method compares favorably with state-of-the-art logit-based distillation approaches.

    "abstract": "Diffusion-based large language models (dLLMs) have recently emerged as a powerful alternative to autoregressive LLMs, offering faster inference and greater interactivity via parallel decoding and bidirectional modeling. However, despite strong performance in code generation and text infilling, we identify a fundamental safety concern: existing alignment mechanisms fail to safeguard dLLMs against context-aware, masked-input adversarial prompts, exposing novel vulnerabilities. To this end, we present DIJA, the first systematic study and jailbreak attack framework that exploits unique safety weaknesses of dLLMs. Specifically, our proposed DIJA constructs adversarial interleaved mask-text prompts that exploit the text generation mechanisms of dLLMs, i.e., bidirectional modeling and parallel decoding. Bidirectional modeling drives the model to produce contextually consistent outputs for masked spans, even when harmful, while parallel decoding limits model dynamic filtering and rejection sampling of unsafe content. This causes standard alignment mechanisms to fail, enabling harmful completions in alignment-tuned dLLMs, even when harmful behaviors or unsafe instructions are directly exposed in the prompt. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that DIJA significantly outperforms existing jailbreak methods, exposing a previously overlooked threat surface in dLLM architectures. Notably, our method achieves up to 100% keyword-based ASR on Dream-Instruct, surpassing the strongest prior baseline, ReNeLLM, by up to 78.5% in evaluator-based ASR on JailbreakBench and by 37.7 points in StrongREJECT score, while requiring no rewriting or hiding of harmful content in the jailbreak prompt. Our findings underscore the urgent need for rethinking safety alignment in this emerging class of language models. Code is available at https://github.com/ZichenWen1/DIJA.",

    "abstract": "Feature-based knowledge distillation aims to transfer intermediate representations from a teacher LLM model to a student. Existing approaches typically rely on direct feature matching or learned projections, implicitly treating representations as objects with intrinsic meaning. However, the relevance of a representation dimension is determined solely by how it affects the model's output. In this work, we propose a functional perspective on feature-based distillation. We characterize knowledge transfer in terms of the teacher's functional geometry, i.e., how its output depends on internal representations, rather than direct representation alignment. This viewpoint reveals that effective distillation need not preserve full high-dimensional features, but instead should retain dominant directions of functional contribution, naturally inducing an effective functional dimension for each task. Building on this framework, we introduce Flex-KD, an architecture-agnostic and parameter-free distillation method that transfers the teacher's functional geometry while matching the student's representational capacity. Extensive experiments across language understanding and generation benchmarks demonstrate that Flex-KD consistently outperforms existing distillation approaches, particularly under severe teacher-student dimension mismatch.",

    "abstract": "In scientific domains -- from biology to the social sciences -- many questions boil down to \\textit{What effect will we observe if we intervene on a particular variable?} If the causal relationships (e.g.~a causal graph) are known, it is possible to estimate the intervention distributions. In the absence of this domain knowledge, the causal structure must be discovered from the available observational data. However, observational data are often compatible with multiple causal graphs, making methods that commit to a single structure prone to overconfidence. A principled way to manage this structural uncertainty is via Bayesian inference, which averages over a posterior distribution on possible causal structures and functional mechanisms. Unfortunately, the number of causal structures grows super-exponentially with the number of nodes in the graph, making computations intractable. We propose to circumvent these challenges by using meta-learning to create an end-to-end model: the Model-Averaged Causal Estimation Transformer Neural Process (MACE-TNP). The model is trained to predict the Bayesian model-averaged interventional posterior distribution, and its end-to-end nature bypasses the need for expensive calculations. Empirically, we demonstrate that MACE-TNP outperforms strong Bayesian baselines. Our work establishes meta-learning as a flexible and scalable paradigm for approximating complex Bayesian causal inference, that can be scaled to increasingly challenging settings in the future.",

In recent times, cognitive decline including Dementia and Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), is often underdiagnosed due to the time-consuming and costly nature of current diagnostic methods. By analyzing real-world driving behavior captured through in-vehicle sensors, this study aims to extract \"digital fingerprints\" that correlate with functional decline and clinical features of dementia. Moreover, modern large vision models can draw meaningful insights from everyday driving patterns across different roadway scenarios to early detect cognitive decline. We propose a framework that uses large vision models and naturalistic driving videos to analyze driver behavior, identify cognitive status and predict disease progression. We leverage the strong relationship between real-world driving behavior as an observation of the current cognitive status of the drivers where the vehicle can be utilized as a \"diagnostic tool\". Our method identifies early warning signs of functional impairment, contributing to proactive intervention strategies. This work enhances early detection and supports the development of scalable, non-invasive monitoring systems to mitigate the growing societal and economic burden of cognitive decline in the aging population.",

    "abstract": "Optical and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) image registration is crucial for multi-modal image fusion and applications. However, several challenges limit the performance of existing deep learning-based methods in cross-modal image registration: (i) significant nonlinear radiometric variations between optical and SAR images affect the shared feature learning and matching; (ii) limited textures in images hinder discriminative feature extraction; (iii) the local receptive field of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) restricts the learning of contextual information, while the Transformer can capture long-range global features but with high computational complexity. To address these issues, this paper proposes a multi-expert learning framework with the State Space Model (ME-SSM) for optical and SAR image registration. Firstly, to improve the registration performance with limited textures, ME-SSM constructs a multi-expert learning framework to capture shared features from multi-modal images. Specifically, it extracts features from various transformations of the input image and employs a learnable soft router to dynamically fuse these features, thereby enriching feature representations and improving registration performance. Secondly, ME-SSM introduces a state space model, Mamba, for feature extraction, which employs a multi-directional cross-scanning strategy to efficiently capture global contextual relationships with linear complexity. ME-SSM can expand the receptive field, enhance image registration accuracy, and avoid incurring high computational costs. Additionally, ME-SSM uses a multi-level feature aggregation (MFA) module to enhance the multi-scale feature fusion and interaction. Extensive experiments have demonstrated the effectiveness and advantages of our proposed ME-SSM on optical and SAR image registration.",

To address this question, we introduce the $\\textit{Common Objects Out-of-Context (COOCo)}$ dataset and conduct experiments on several VLMs under different degrees of scene-object congruency and noise. We find that models leverage scene context adaptively, depending on scene-object semantic relatedness and noise level. Based on these consistent trends across models, we turn to the question of how VLM attention patterns change as a function of target-scene semantic fit, and to what degree these patterns are predictive of categorisation accuracy. We find that successful object categorisation is associated with increased mid-layer attention to the target. We also find a non-monotonic dependency on semantic fit, with attention dropping at moderate fit and increasing for both low and high fit. These results suggest that VLMs dynamically balance local and contextual information for reference generation.

Unlike sparse local detectors, satellite imagery offers consistent, city-wide road and traffic information of both parking and moving vehicles, overcoming data availability limitations. To extract information from imagery data, we design a computer vision pipeline for class-specific vehicle detection and map matching, generating link-level traffic density observations by vehicle class. Building upon this information, we formulate a computational graph-based DODE framework that calibrates dynamic network states by jointly matching observed traffic counts/speeds from local sensors with density measurements derived from satellite imagery. To assess the accuracy and robustness of the proposed framework, we conduct a series of numerical experiments using both synthetic and real-world data. The results demonstrate that supplementing traditional data with satellite-derived density significantly improves estimation performance, especially for links without local sensors. Real-world experiments also show the framework's potential for practical deployment on large-scale networks. Sensitivity analysis further evaluates the impact of data quality related to satellite imagery data.",

First, we introduce SIMSHIFT, a novel benchmark dataset and evaluation suite composed of four industrial simulation tasks spanning diverse processes and physics: hot rolling, sheet metal forming, electric motor design and heatsink design. Second, we extend established UDA methods to state-of-the-art neural surrogates and systematically evaluate them. Extensive experiments on SIMSHIFT highlight the challenges of out-of-distribution neural surrogate modeling, demonstrate the potential of UDA in simulation, and reveal open problems in achieving robust neural surrogates under distribution shifts in industrially relevant scenarios.

While Minecraft has emerged as a compelling benchmark, existing agents often suffer from fragmented cognitive abilities, lacking the synergy between reflexive execution (System 1) and deliberative reasoning (System 2). In this paper, we introduce Optimus-3, a generalist agent that organically integrates these dual capabilities within a unified framework. To achieve this, we address three fundamental challenges. First, to overcome the scarcity of reasoning data, we propose a Knowledge-Enhanced Automated Data Generation Pipeline. It synthesizes high-quality System 2 reasoning traces from raw System 1 interaction trajectories, effectively mitigating hallucinations via injection of domain knowledge. We release the resulting dataset, \\textbf{OptimusM$^{4}$}, to the community. Second, to reconcile the dichotomous computational requirements of the dual systems, we design a Dual-Router Aligned MoE Architecture. It employs a Task Router to prevent task interference via parameter decoupling, and a Layer Router to dynamically modulate reasoning depth, creating a computational ``Fast Path'' for System 1 and a ``Deep Path'' for System 2. Third, to activate the reasoning capabilities of System 2, we propose Dual-Granularity Reasoning-Aware Policy Optimization (DGRPO) algorithm. It enforces Process-Outcome Co-Supervision via dual-granularity dense rewards, ensuring consistency between the thought process and the answer. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that Optimus-3 surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods on both System~2 (21$\\%$ on Planning, 66\\% on Captioning, 76\\% on Embodied QA, 3.4$\\times$ on Grounding, and 18\\% on Reflection) and System~1 (3\\% on Long-Horizon Action) tasks, with a notable 60\\% success rate on open-ended tasks.",

However, multi-hop reasoning poses two key challenges: (1)~maintaining coherent reasoning paths, and (2)~avoiding prematurely discarding critical multi-hop connections. To tackle these challenges, we introduce iQUEST, a question-guided KBQA framework that iteratively decomposes complex queries into simpler sub-questions, ensuring a structured and focused reasoning trajectory. Additionally, we integrate a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to look ahead and incorporate 2-hop neighbor information at each reasoning step. This dual approach strengthens the reasoning process, enabling the model to explore viable paths more effectively. Detailed experiments demonstrate the consistent improvement delivered by iQUEST across four benchmark datasets and four LLMs.",

    "abstract": "Geometric spatial reasoning forms the foundation of many applications in artificial intelligence, yet the ability of large language models (LLMs) to operate over geometric spatial information expressed in procedural code remains underexplored. In this paper, we address this gap by formalizing the Program-to-Geometry task, which challenges models to translate programmatic drawing code into accurate and abstract geometric reasoning. To evaluate this capability, we present GeoGramBench, a benchmark of 500 carefully refined problems organized by a tailored three-level taxonomy that considers geometric complexity rather than traditional mathematical reasoning complexity. Our comprehensive evaluation of 17 frontier LLMs reveals consistent and pronounced deficiencies: even the most advanced models achieve less than 50% accuracy at the highest abstraction level. These results highlight the unique challenges posed by program-driven spatial reasoning and establish GeoGramBench as a valuable resource for advancing research in symbolic-to-spatial geometric reasoning.

    "abstract": "Model editing techniques are essential for efficiently updating knowledge in large language models (LLMs). However, the effectiveness of existing approaches degrades in massive editing scenarios, particularly when evaluated with practical metrics. Their robustness is also limited in context-rich settings or when editing multiple facts of the same subject simultaneously. We attribute these failures to the embedding misalignment among knowledge items, which undermines editing reliability at scale. To address this, we propose EAMET (Embedding Alignment Model Editing in Transformers), which addresses this issue by aligning the space of key and residual embeddings. Extensive experiments across six LLMs and three datasets demonstrate that EAMET consistently outperforms existing methods, achieving about 90\\% editing efficacy when editing 10k facts.

This study investigates federated learning (FL) as a privacy-preserving solution to collaboratively train robust surgical FMs. Methods: We introduce Federated EndoViT (FL-EndoViT), a federated framework that validates the Masked Autoencoder (MAE) pretraining strategy in a decentralized surgical setting. To ensure convergence under severe data heterogeneity, the architecture integrates adaptive Sharpness-Aware Minimization (FedSAM). Pretrained on the large-scale Endo700k dataset, FL-EndoViT is evaluated against a centralized baseline on different tasks including scene segmentation, action recognition, and phase recognition. Results: FedSAM is critical for successful pretraining, overcoming the convergence failures of standard federated methods. The resulting FL-EndoViT performs comparably to its centralized counterpart, with significant advantages in data-scarce, high-resolution segmentation and generalization to new surgical events. We also establish that full, end-to-end fine-tuning is necessary for optimal performance. Conclusion: This work validates FL with adaptive optimization as a viable paradigm for creating robust, privacy-preserving surgical FMs. Our findings provide a scalable framework for collaborative Surgical Data Science and underscore the optimizer's critical role in handling data heterogeneity. Future work should explore video-based models to incorporate spatiotemporal dynamics.",

    "abstract": "Human Pose Estimation (HPE) involves detecting and localizing keypoints on the human body from visual data. In 3D HPE, occlusions, where parts of the body are not visible in the image, pose a significant challenge for accurate pose reconstruction. This paper presents a benchmark on the robustness of 3D HPE models under realistic occlusion conditions, involving combinations of occluded keypoints commonly observed in real-world scenarios. We evaluate nine state-of-the-art 2D-to-3D HPE models, spanning convolutional, transformer-based, graph-based, and diffusion-based architectures, using the BlendMimic3D dataset, a synthetic dataset with ground-truth 2D/3D annotations and occlusion labels. All models were originally trained on Human3.6M and tested here without retraining to assess their generalization. We introduce a protocol that simulates occlusion by adding noise into 2D keypoints based on real detector behavior, and conduct both global and per-joint sensitivity analyses. Our findings reveal that all models exhibit notable performance degradation under occlusion, with diffusion-based models underperforming despite their stochastic nature. Additionally, a per-joint occlusion analysis identifies consistent vulnerability in distal joints (e.g., wrists, feet) across models. Overall, this work highlights critical limitations of current 3D HPE models in handling occlusions, and provides insights for improving real-world robustness.",

    "abstract": "Prior studies on deception in language-based AI agents typically assess whether the agent produces a false statement about a topic, or makes a binary choice prompted by a goal, rather than allowing open-ended deceptive behavior to emerge in pursuit of a longer-term goal. To fix this, we introduce Among Us, a sandbox social deception game where LLM-agents exhibit long-term, open-ended deception as a consequence of the game objectives. While most benchmarks saturate quickly, Among Us can be expected to last much longer, because it is a multi-player game far from equilibrium. Using the sandbox, we evaluate 18 proprietary and open-weight LLMs and uncover a general trend: models trained with RL are comparatively much better at producing deception than detecting it. We evaluate the effectiveness of methods to detect lying and deception: logistic regression on the activations and sparse autoencoders (SAEs). We find that probes trained on a dataset of \"pretend you're a dishonest model:..\" generalize extremely well out-of-distribution, consistently obtaining AUROCs over 95% even when evaluated just on the deceptive statement, without the chain of thought. We also find two SAE features that work well at deception detection but are unable to steer the model to lie less. We hope our open-sourced sandbox, game logs, and probes serve to anticipate and mitigate deceptive behavior and capabilities in language-based agents.",

    "abstract": "Accurate segmentation and mapping of sea ice types is crucial for safe polar navigation, offshore operations, and climate monitoring. While deep learning has demonstrated strong potential for automating sea ice type segmentation, its success often relies on access to extensive expert labeled datasets, which is both resource intensive and time consuming to create. However, foundation models (FMs), recently developed through self-supervised training on large-scale datasets, have demonstrated impressive performance. Nevertheless, their applicability to sea ice type segmentation based on Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery remains uncertain due to the unique challenges posed by sea ice such as intricate geophysical patterns, pronounced seasonal variability, and SAR-specific artifacts like banding, scalloping, and heterogeneous backscatter as well as the fact that SAR data in polar regions are often acquired using specialized sensor modes that differ markedly from those used to collect FM training data at lower latitudes, limiting their direct transferability to polar environments. To address this gap, we contribute: (1) IceFMBench, a comprehensive benchmark framework for evaluation of the state-of-the-art remote sensing FMs on the sea ice type segmentation task using Sentinel1 SAR imagery, where IceFMBench is composed of a widely used standardized dataset, diverse evaluation metrics, and a representative set of selected remote sensing FM models suitable for sea ice type segmentation, with the ability to include new models side by side the existing models; (2) an extensive comparative evaluation of the representative FMs using IceFMBench, with additional case studies to assess performance of the top-performing model in terms of transferability across temporal and spatial domains and (3) a multi teacher knowledge distillation approach to address lack of spatiotemporal transferability.",

The common practice for CFG-based training is to use a single network to learn both conditional and unconditional noise prediction, with a small dropout rate for conditioning. However, we observe that the joint learning of unconditional noise with limited bandwidth in training results in poor priors for the unconditional case. More importantly, these poor unconditional noise predictions become a serious reason for degrading the quality of conditional generation. Inspired by the fact that most CFG-based conditional models are trained by fine-tuning a base model with better unconditional generation, we first show that simply replacing the unconditional noise in CFG with that predicted by the base model can significantly improve conditional generation. Furthermore, we show that a diffusion model other than the one the fine-tuned model was trained on can be used for unconditional noise replacement. We experimentally verify our claim with a range of CFG-based conditional models for both image and video generation, including Zero-1-to-3, Versatile Diffusion, DiT, DynamiCrafter, and InstructPix2Pix.",

While recent approaches attempt to address this limitation by learning equivariant features using linear operators in feature space, they impose restrictive assumptions that constrain flexibility and generalization. We introduce a weaker definition for the transformation relation between image and feature space denoted as equivariance-coherence. We propose a novel SSL auxiliary task that learns equivariance-coherent representations through intermediate transformation reconstruction, which can be integrated with existing joint embedding SSL methods. Our key idea is to reconstruct images at intermediate points along transformation paths, e.g. when training on 30-degree rotations, we reconstruct the 10-degree and 20-degree rotation states. Reconstructing intermediate states requires the transformation information used in augmentations, rather than suppressing it, and therefore fosters features containing the augmented transformation information. Our method decomposes feature vectors into invariant and equivariant parts, training them with standard SSL losses and reconstruction losses, respectively. We demonstrate substantial improvements on synthetic equivariance benchmarks while maintaining competitive performance on downstream tasks requiring invariant representations. The approach seamlessly integrates with existing SSL methods (iBOT, DINOv2) and consistently enhances performance across diverse tasks, including segmentation, detection, depth estimation, and video dense prediction. Our framework provides a practical way for augmenting SSL methods with equivariant capabilities while preserving invariant performance.",

Yet, existing frameworks fail to address the key step of producing output suitable for broader dissemination to the general public: while human fact-checkers communicate their findings through fact-checking articles, automated systems typically produce little or no justification for their assessments. Here, we aim to bridge this gap. In particular, we argue for the need to extend the typical automatic fact-checking pipeline with automatic generation of full fact-checking articles. We first identify key desiderata for such articles through a series of interviews with experts from leading fact-checking organizations. We then develop QRAFT, an LLM-based agentic framework that mimics the writing workflow of human fact-checkers. Finally, we assess the practical usefulness of QRAFT through human evaluations with professional fact-checkers. Our evaluation shows that while QRAFT outperforms several previously proposed text-generation approaches, it lags considerably behind expert-written articles. We hope that our work will enable further research in this new and important direction. The code for our implementation is available at https://github.com/mbzuai-nlp/qraft.git.",

    "abstract": "Tabular data poses unique challenges for deep learning due to its heterogeneous feature types, lack of spatial structure, and often limited sample sizes. We propose TabNSA, a novel deep learning framework that integrates Native Sparse Attention (NSA) with a TabMixer backbone to efficiently model tabular data. TabNSA tackles computational and representational challenges by dynamically focusing on relevant feature subsets per instance. The NSA module employs a hierarchical sparse attention mechanism, including token compression, selective preservation, and localized sliding windows, to significantly reduce the quadratic complexity of standard attention operations while addressing feature heterogeneity. Complementing this, the TabMixer backbone captures complex, non-linear dependencies through parallel multilayer perceptron (MLP) branches with independent parameters. These modules are synergistically combined via element-wise summation and mean pooling, enabling TabNSA to model both global context and fine-grained interactions. Extensive experiments across supervised and transfer learning settings show that TabNSA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art deep learning models. Furthermore, by augmenting TabNSA with a fine-tuned large language model (LLM), we enable it to effectively address Few-Shot Learning challenges through language-guided generalization on diverse tabular benchmarks.

    "abstract": "Active feature acquisition (AFA) studies how to sequentially acquire features for each data instance to trade off predictive performance against acquisition cost. This survey offers the first unified treatment of AFA via an explicit partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) formulation. We place this formulation in the broader literature on optimal information acquisition and, more specifically, in a family of structured POMDPs (for example, information-gathering and sensing POMDPs) whose assumptions and algorithmic tools directly apply to AFA. This connection provides a common language for comparing problem settings and methods, and it highlights where AFA can leverage established results in structured POMDP planning and approximation. Building on this perspective, we present an up-to-date taxonomy of AFA methods that (roughly) mirrors standard approaches to solving POMDPs: (i) embedded cost-aware predictors (notably cost-sensitive decision trees and ensembles), (ii) model-based methods that plan using learned probabilistic components, (iii) model-free methods that learn acquisition policies from simulated episodes, and (iv) hybrid methods that combine the strengths of model-based and model-free approaches. We argue that this POMDP-centric view clarifies connections among existing methods and motivates more principled algorithm design. Since much prior work is heuristic and lacks formal guarantees, we also outline routes to guarantees by connecting AFA to adaptive stochastic optimization. We conclude by highlighting open challenges and promising directions for future research.",

    "abstract": "Active vision enables dynamic visual perception, offering an alternative to static feedforward architectures in computer vision, which rely on large datasets and high computational resources. Biological selective attention mechanisms allow agents to focus on salient Regions of Interest (ROIs), reducing computational demand while maintaining real-time responsiveness. Event-based cameras, inspired by the mammalian retina, enhance this capability by capturing asynchronous scene changes enabling efficient low-latency processing. To distinguish moving objects while the event-based camera is in motion the agent requires an object motion segmentation mechanism to accurately detect targets and center them in the visual field (fovea). Integrating event-based sensors with neuromorphic algorithms represents a paradigm shift, using Spiking Neural Networks to parallelize computation and adapt to dynamic environments. This work presents a Spiking Convolutional Neural Network bioinspired attention system for selective attention through object motion sensitivity. The system generates events via fixational eye movements using a Dynamic Vision Sensor integrated into the Speck neuromorphic hardware, mounted on a Pan-Tilt unit, to identify the ROI and saccade toward it. The system, characterized using ideal gratings and benchmarked against the Event Camera Motion Segmentation Dataset, reaches a mean IoU of 82.2% and a mean SSIM of 96% in multi-object motion segmentation. The detection of salient objects reaches 88.8% accuracy in office scenarios and 89.8% in low-light conditions on the Event-Assisted Low-Light Video Object Segmentation Dataset. A real-time demonstrator shows the system's 0.12 s response to dynamic scenes. Its learning-free design ensures robustness across perceptual scenes, making it a reliable foundation for real-time robotic applications serving as a basis for more complex architectures.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents deep meta coordination graphs (DMCG) for learning cooperative policies in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). Coordination graph formulations encode local interactions and accordingly factorize the joint value function of all agents to improve efficiency in MARL. Through DMCG, we dynamically compose what we refer to as \\textit{meta coordination graphs}, to learn a more expressive representation of agent interactions and use them to integrate agent information through graph convolutional networks. The goal is to enable an evolving coordination graph to guide effective coordination in cooperative MARL tasks. The graphs are jointly optimized with agents' value functions to learn to implicitly reason about joint actions, facilitating the end-to-end learning of interaction representations and coordinated policies. We demonstrate that DMCG consistently achieves state-of-the-art coordination performance and sample efficiency on challenging cooperative tasks, outperforming several prior graph-based and non-graph-based MARL baselines. Through several ablations, we also isolate the impact of individual components in DMCG, showing that the observed improvements are due to the meaningful design choices in this approach. We also include an analysis of its computational complexity to discuss its practicality in real-world applications.

However, they usually fail to produce satisfactory outputs that are aligned to users' authentic demands and preferences. In this work, we introduce Dual-Iterative Optimization (Dual-IPO), an iterative paradigm that sequentially optimizes both the reward model and the video generation model for improved synthesis quality and human preference alignment. For the reward model, our framework ensures reliable and robust reward signals via CoT-guided reasoning, voting-based self-consistency, and preference certainty estimation. Given this, we optimize video foundation models with guidance of signals from reward model's feedback, thus improving the synthesis quality in subject consistency, motion smoothness and aesthetic quality, etc. The reward model and video generation model complement each other and are progressively improved in the multi-round iteration, without requiring tediously manual preference annotations. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed Dual-IPO can effectively and consistently improve the video generation quality of base model with various architectures and sizes, even help a model with only 2B parameters surpass a 5B one. Moreover, our analysis experiments and ablation studies identify the rational of our systematic design and the efficacy of each component.",

Our method enforces a constant rate of change in the probability distribution of diffused data throughout the diffusion process, where the rate of change is quantified using a user-defined discrepancy measure. We introduce three such measures, which can be flexibly selected or combined depending on the domain and model architecture. While our framework is inspired by theoretical insights, we do not aim to provide a complete theoretical justification of how distributional change affects sample quality. Instead, we focus on establishing a general-purpose scheduling framework and validating its empirical effectiveness. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our approach consistently improves the performance of both pixel-space and latent-space diffusion models, across various datasets, samplers, and a wide range of number of function evaluations from 5 to 250. In particular, when applied to both training and sampling schedules, our method achieves a state-of-the-art FID score of 2.03 on LSUN Horse 256$\\times$256, without compromising mode coverage.",

Unlike existing methods that rely on fixed reference images to construct a complete story, our approach features a novel external iterative paradigm, extending beyond the internal iterative denoising steps of diffusion models, to continuously refine each generated image by incorporating all reference images from the previous round. To achieve this, we propose a plug-and-play, training-free global reference cross-attention (GRCA) module, modeling all reference frames with global embeddings, ensuring semantic consistency in long sequences. By progressively incorporating holistic visual context and text constraints, our iterative paradigm enables precise generation with fine-grained interactions, optimizing the story visualization step-by-step. Extensive experiments in the official story visualization dataset and our long story benchmark demonstrate that Story-Iter's state-of-the-art performance in long-story visualization (up to 100 frames) excels in both semantic consistency and fine-grained interactions.",

    "abstract": "Models initialized from self-supervised pretraining may suffer from poor alignment with downstream tasks, reducing the extent to which subsequent fine-tuning can adapt pretrained features toward downstream objectives. To mitigate this, we introduce BiSSL, a novel bilevel training framework that enhances the alignment of self-supervised pretrained models with downstream tasks prior to fine-tuning. BiSSL acts as an intermediate training stage conducted after conventional self-supervised pretraining and is tasked with solving a bilevel optimization problem that incorporates the pretext and downstream training objectives in its lower- and upper-level objectives, respectively. This approach explicitly models the interdependence between the pretraining and fine-tuning stages within the conventional self-supervised learning pipeline, facilitating enhanced information sharing between them that ultimately leads to a model initialization better aligned with the downstream task. We propose a general training algorithm for BiSSL that is compatible with a broad range of pretext and downstream tasks. Using SimCLR and Bootstrap Your Own Latent to pretrain ResNet-50 backbones on the ImageNet dataset, we demonstrate that our proposed framework significantly improves accuracy on the vast majority of 12 downstream image classification datasets, as well as on object detection. Exploratory analyses alongside investigative experiments further provide compelling evidence that BiSSL enhances downstream alignment.",

    "abstract": "Inverse materials design has proven successful in accelerating novel material discovery. Many inverse materials design methods use unsupervised learning where a latent space is learned to offer a compact description of materials representations. A latent space learned this way is likely to be entangled, in terms of the target property and other properties of the materials. This makes the inverse design process ambiguous. Here, we present a semi-supervised learning approach based on a disentangled variational autoencoder to learn a probabilistic relationship between features, latent variables and target properties. This approach is data efficient because it combines all labelled and unlabelled data in a coherent manner, and it uses expert-informed prior distributions to improve model robustness even with limited labelled data. It is in essence interpretable, as the learnable target property is disentangled out of the other properties of the materials, and an extra layer of interpretability can be provided by a post-hoc analysis of the classification head of the model. We demonstrate this new approach on an experimental high-entropy alloy dataset with chemical compositions as input and single-phase formation as the single target property. High-entropy alloys were chosen as example materials because of the vast chemical space of their possible combinations of compositions and atomic configurations. While single property is used in this work, the disentangled model can be extended to customize for inverse design of materials with multiple target properties.",

    "abstract": "Dance plays an important role as an artistic form and expression in human culture, yet automatically generating dance sequences is a significant yet challenging endeavor. Existing approaches often neglect the critical aspect of controllability in dance generation. Additionally, they inadequately model the nuanced impact of music styles, resulting in dances that lack alignment with the expressive characteristics inherent in the conditioned music. To address this gap, we propose Style-Guided Motion Diffusion (SGMD), which integrates the Transformer-based architecture with a Style Modulation module. By incorporating music features with user-provided style prompts, the SGMD ensures that the generated dances not only match the musical content but also reflect the desired stylistic characteristics. To enable flexible control over the generated dances, we introduce a spatial-temporal masking mechanism. As controllable dance generation has not been fully studied, we construct corresponding experimental setups and benchmarks for tasks such as trajectory-based dance generation, dance in-betweening, and dance inpainting. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach can generate realistic and stylistically consistent dances, while also empowering users to create dances tailored to diverse artistic and practical needs.

However, these models are constrained to basic instruction-following or descriptive tasks, facing challenges in complex real-world remote sensing applications that require specialized tools and knowledge. To address these limitations, we propose RS-Agent, an AI agent designed to interact with human users and autonomously leverage specialized models to address the demands of real-world remote sensing applications. RS-Agent integrates four key components: a Central Controller based on large language models, a dynamic toolkit for tool execution, a Solution Space for task-specific expert guidance, and a Knowledge Space for domain-level reasoning, enabling it to interpret user queries and orchestrate tools for accurate remote sensing task. We introduce two novel mechanisms: Task-Aware Retrieval, which improves tool selection accuracy through expert-guided planning, and DualRAG, a retrieval-augmented generation method that enhances knowledge relevance through weighted, dual-path retrieval. RS-Agent supports flexible integration of new tools and is compatible with both open-source and proprietary LLMs. Extensive experiments across 9 datasets and 18 remote sensing tasks demonstrate that RS-Agent significantly outperforms state-of-the-art MLLMs, achieving over 95% task planning accuracy and delivering superior performance in tasks such as scene classification, object counting, and remote sensing visual question answering.

Among the available techniques, the ordinary differential equation (ODE) method is particularly appealing as a general-purpose, off-the-shelf tool for sanity-checking the convergence of a wide range of reinforcement learning algorithms. In this paper, we develop a unified ODE-based convergence framework that applies to standard Q-learning and several soft/smoothed variants, including those built on the log-sum-exponential softmax, Boltzmann softmax, and mellowmax operators. Our analysis uses a smooth p-norm Lyapunov function, leading to concise yet rigorous stability arguments and circumventing the non-smoothness issues inherent to classical infty-norm-based approaches. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed framework is among the first to provide a unified ODE-based treatment that is broadly applicable to smooth Q-learning algorithms while also encompassing standard Q-learning. Moreover, it remains valid even in settings where the associated Bellman operator is not a contraction, as may happen in Boltzmann soft Q-learning.",

Many efforts have been dedicated to deriving score functions based on logits, distances, or rigorous data distribution assumptions to identify low-scoring OOD samples. Nevertheless, these estimate scores may fail to accurately reflect the true data density or impose impractical constraints. To provide a unified perspective on density-based score design, we propose a novel theoretical framework grounded in Bregman divergence, which extends distribution considerations to encompass an exponential family of distributions. Leveraging the conjugation constraint revealed in our theorem, we introduce a \\textsc{ConjNorm} method, reframing density function design as a search for the optimal norm coefficient $p$ against the given dataset. In light of the computational challenges of normalization, we devise an unbiased and analytically tractable estimator of the partition function using the Monte Carlo-based importance sampling technique.
